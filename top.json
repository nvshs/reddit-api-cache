Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.\n\n* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed.

Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.\n\n* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.\n\n* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as \"My...\", \"Mine...\", \"Our...\", \"We...\", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.\n\n###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** \nPlease cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.\n\n* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**\n* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)\n\n###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**\n\n* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: \n  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing &amp; ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.\n\n###8) **Reddiquette, Comments &amp; Subreddit Behavior:**\n\n* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.\n* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.\n* The definition of what truly is \"Oddly Satisfying\" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.\n\n###9) **Crossposts**\n* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma. \n\n#####Related subreddits:\n* /r/ArtisanVideos \n\n* /r/asmr \n\n* /r/clonedgif \n\n* /r/interestingasfuck \n\n* /r/knolling \n\n* /r/loadingicon \n\n* /r/lookscool \n\n* /r/mesmerizinggifs \n\n* /r/mildlyinfuriating \n\n* /r/mildlyinteresting \n\n* r/OrganizationPorn \n\n* /r/parasnailing \n\n* /r/perfectfit \n\n* /r/perfectLoops \n\n* /r/pic \n\n* /r/powerwashingporn \n\n* /r/satisfyinggrass\n\n* /r/showerthoughts \n\n* /r/simulated \n\n* /r/slightlyunsatisfying \n\n* /r/SlyGifs   \n\n* /r/ThatPeelingFeeling\n\n* /r/ThisBlewMyMind \n\n* /r/WtWFotMJaJtRAtCaB [SFW]","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"oddlysatisfying","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6NYespd3jy62IgAehgvHjNFg8z9zBIlFefIn2ZrF5oQ.png","title":"Oddly Satisfying","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#00a6a5","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/65GJujMgAXbydbxxFPYm6eck1YffqR-anhX4-hxnVhQ.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[115,120],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9401391,"submit_text_label":"Texty-text text","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/oddlysatisfying","key_color":"#ff66ac","name":"t5_2x93b","created":1368595528,"url":"/r/oddlysatisfying/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1368595528,"banner_size":[1280,384],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"For those little things that are inexplicably satisfying.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"mildlyinteresting","title":"Sign at a restaurant claiming they closed to take the staff to Vegas","ups":57375,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":["giphy"],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":false,"community_icon":null,"show_media":true,"description":"Aww, cripes.

No x-posts or reposts\n&gt; Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.\n\n&gt; **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post.

Original [OC] photographs only\n&gt; **a.** No gifs, videos, or websites.  \n\n&gt; **b.** All submissions must be original content. If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.  \n\n&gt; **c.** Software glitches/errors, overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed, although you may censor personal information per Reddit-wide rules.\n\n&gt; **d.** Side by side images are okay if they adhere to the rest of the rules.\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###5.

Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n&gt; **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n&gt; **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n&gt; **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image.

Post screenshots of discovered brand new sentences**\n\nPost must be a screenshot of the sentence, as well as some additional context. \n\nSentences that qualify as \"brand new\", in the terms accepted by this subreddit, have the following atributes:\n\n- never been said before, or said few enough times to qualify as \"almost new\" \n\n- not an idiom (or a translated idiom)\n\n- humorous or confusingly worded\n\n**2\\. Check if the sentence has been said before before posting**\n\nIt is encouraged to perform a Google search of the sentence before posting it. Use the `\"` character (double quotation marks) to search for the exact string of words in order to produce the best results.\n\nIf the results produced are many and have various apparition dates, it is most likely that the sentence is brand new. \n\nIf there are many results, but all on the same day, the sentence is likely new (and therefore qualifies for this sub) but has become popular (which is OK).\n\n**3\\. Reposts are not allowed**\n\nSearch for the sentence on this sub, in order to avoid your post being taken down due to a repost.\n\n**4\\. Avoid satire and shitposting**\n\nHere is an example of a [sentence that is meant as a joke](https://reddit.app.link/CG0Fo6efyV), in a satirical way. Due to highly popular demand, this kind of posts are no longer accepted on this sub.\n\nThis is not a meme sub.\n\n**5\\. Do not post sentences created by bots**\n\n**6\\. The brand new sentence should be in the title**\n\nIt is encouraged to use the new sentence as the title. If you don't want to do this, use a creative title.\n\nTitles that are considered boring and will be removed:\n\n- *I think this belongs here*\n\n- *One of my friends said this*\n\n- *Found on...*\n\n- *On a topic about...*\n\n- *What* / *Lol* / *I don't even know where to begin*\n\n- *This whole thread* / *Two in one*\n\n**7\\. Link the source in the comments**\n\nThis rule applies to sentences found on the Internet.\n\nExceptions to this rule are:\n\n- text messages (sms, WhatsApp, Discord)\n\n- Facebook posts on private groups\n\n**8\\. Be civil**\n\n**9\\. Do not incite political or ideological debates**\n\nYou must not, under any circumstances, comment on a post in order to incite debate. This is usually the case with sentences that mildly refer to controversial topics such as politics, LGBT+, vaccinations etc.\n\nPlease keep this sub relevant to its purpose and do not flood the comments section with off topic debates. Any debate is off topic as long as it is beside the point of the subreddit: enjoying the novelty of a sentence.","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"BrandNewSentence","header_img":null,"title":"Brand New Sentence","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#1f75ff","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/1PhI1RV2f3dWW-Bl9zEJ0QK6KkRZTY20B030d2e8L7E.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Post a screenshot","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":1114660,"submit_text_label":"Make an announcement","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/BrandNewSentence","key_color":"#0079d3","name":"t5_mbn0j","created":1532562135,"url":"/r/BrandNewSentence/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1532562135,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"For sentences never before written, found in the wild.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"pics","title":"This was found at an antique shop in Miami","ups":52241,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":["giphy"],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":null,"show_media":true,"description":"[Rules](/r/pics/wiki/index)\n\n1.

No content involving people harming or harassing animals. Please do not submit sunrises, sunsets, or other content which does not have an element of 'wow-factor'. No posting of photoshopped or otherwise excessively and unnecessarily manipulated images.\n\n#####`2.` **Submission Titles**\n\n&gt; Every post title must begin with the fire emoji (🔥) and a space. The fire emoji defines this community. Your post will be automatically removed if you do not follow this rule.\n\n&gt;Titles should be accurate and descriptive: low effort titles will be removed. Include the animal/plant name, a location, and brief description to the best of your ability. Titles cannot say \"[Subject] is Lit\".\n\n#####`3.`  **Reposts**\n\n&gt;No posts that have been previously posted on this subreddit within 120 days (4 months) may be posted again. No posts that have previously been posted on this subreddit with over 10,000 upvotes in the past year may be posted again.\n\n&gt;Search the subreddit for key terms like the animal name before posting to check if your post is a repost. You can also use KarmaDecay and Google Reverse Image Search. Spamming many posts or excessive cross-posting in an attempt to karma farm will get you banned. \n\n#####`5.` **NSFW/L**  \n\n&gt;We do not allow NSFW content: bloody, gory and violent content can be redirected to our sister subreddit /r/natureismetal.\n\n\n#####`6.` **Human Concerns**  \n\n&gt; No politics, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, diet, or similar topics of human conceit. We are here for the awesomeness of nature. Any references to these topics will be removed.\n\n**REGARDING HIDDEN ACCOUNT AGE/KARMA THRESHOLD**\n\nWe hide the exact amounts to combat the rampant spam on this subreddit, this was the only way we found to significantly fight the spam/repost bot accounts. These numbers are not high and don’t take long to achieve, but the exact numbers are hidden so karma farming bots can’t just meet them easily then come here. Please do not send us a message to inquire about our karma rules. It's a question we do not and will not answer, nor do we override. Go out and build your numbers and try again in the future - we're not going anywhere :) \n\n##Please Visit Our Sister Subreddits:\n\nFor badass nature in all its gorey brutality, visit /r/natureismetal.\n\nFor cool extinct nature, check out /r/Naturewasmetal.\n\nFor people being badasses, visit /r/Humansaremetal.\n\nFor dead animals doing crazy things from the afterlife, check out /r/taxidermy and /r/taxidermyismetal.\n\n\n##[**User Flair**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/wiki/index#wiki_user_flairs)  \n##[**Subreddit Charities**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/wiki/charities)\n##[Moderator Feedback](/message/compose/?to=%2Fr%2FNatureIsFuckingLit&amp;subject=%2Fr%2FNatureIsFuckingLit%20Feedback)\n##[Moderators List](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/about/moderators)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"NatureIsFuckingLit","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tzrObEQglQISdgQA34GjDYEm1BwuX3cM32DHk4F2OeQ.png","title":"🔥 Nature Is Fucking Lit","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#ffffff","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xNPwgp0SenX_J5sXRiGKNFLUa09-RxJlBp2mG2Gq5AU.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[45,45],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":10137855,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/NatureIsFuckingLit","key_color":"#ff8717","name":"t5_3gdh7","created":1474215158,"url":"/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1474215158,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"We are here to appreciate the awesome majesty and incredibly cool aspects of nature. 🔥","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"Damnthatsinteresting","title":"Vet treating a very agressive cat","ups":43178,"post_hint":"hosted:video","media":{"reddit_video":{"bitrate_kbps":4800,"fallback_url":"https://v.redd.it/ld4n26i6i3xa1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback","height":1080,"width":608,"scrubber_media_url":"https://v.redd.it/ld4n26i6i3xa1/DASH_96.mp4","dash_url":"https://v.redd.it/ld4n26i6i3xa1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1685548813%2CN2I0ODk0NGRmYzRlOTllMjQ1M2VmZDA0NjZjNTI2ZDFhMjI1M2JjNzc1ZjM2NjVkZmE4ZjY3YTFjYjNkMDIzYQ%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","duration":60,"hls_url":"https://v.redd.it/ld4n26i6i3xa1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1685548813%2CNGJjMDYyNzkwYmVhYzJlYWM3NmU2MDhlNzYxMzYwNzI3MTUzN2Y5NWRhNWY0MDVmYWQ0NGFiYWE5MDdlMjA3OA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","is_gif":false,"transcoding_status":"completed"}},"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PVPAHxxDZQyuSpRNyy_58hV8a5etmtYbMTfsiURAFH4.png","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":null,"show_media":true,"description":"[Image](http://www.reddit.com/r/damnthatsinteresting/search?q=flair%3A%27Image%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n[GIF](http://www.reddit.com/r/damnthatsinteresting/search?q=flair%3A%27GIF%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n[Gallery](http://www.reddit.com/r/damnthatsinteresting/search?q=flair%3A%27Gallery%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n[Video](http://www.reddit.com/r/damnthatsinteresting/search?q=flair%3A%27Video%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n[Website](http://www.reddit.com/r/damnthatsinteresting/search?q=flair%3A%27Website%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n\n\n\n\n[New to reddit? click here!](/wiki/reddit_101)\n\n## [Rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/about/rules/)\n\n* Only \"Damnthatsinteresting\" content.
