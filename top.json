This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).\n####What does \"Oddly Satisfying\" mean?\nWe are forever searching for a \"true definition\". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* \"oddly satisfying\" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.\n\n***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**\n\n######Rules:\n**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**\n###1)  **Banned Topics:**\nWe have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:\n\n* **Memes or image macros**\n\n* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as \"2048\", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.\n\n* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.\n\n* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).\n\n* **Compilation Albums/Videos**\n  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**\n  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).\n  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.\n\n* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.\n\n* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. \n\n###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** \nNSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (\"Say it, don't show it.\"). \n\n###3)  **Reposts:** \n**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.\n\n* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.\n\n* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as \"My...\", \"Mine...\", \"Our...\", \"We...\", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.\n\n###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** \nPlease cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.\n\n* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**\n* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)\n\n###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**\n\n* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: \n  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing &amp; ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.\n\n###8) **Reddiquette, Comments &amp; Subreddit Behavior:**\n\n* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.\n* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly.

Don’t violate Reddit's Content Policy**\n1. Pretty simple. Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, incite violence, etc. Find the content policy [here] (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). If you disagree with this, take it up with the admins, because we have no say in them.\n\n\n###**II. Don't be a cunt**\n\n1. Also simple. If you come to this sub to be a cunt and to argue about politics, religion, etc in an uncivil way, then you will be banned. This is a shitposting sub dammit, not r/politics.\n\n\n###**III. Shitposts 😃 God awful posts 😡**\n\n1. This subreddit is for shitposts, not gawdawfulposts. and yes, repost chains/blatant karmawhoring posts are godawfulposts, not shitposts. Posting literal shit=ban. [Due to the poll addressing user complaints](https://redd.it/piumy6) the following are now being removed: unoriginal comment baiting posts (AMA, start arguing, ask questions and edit) and CUM spam. \n\n\n###**IV. Mod discretion**\n\n1. Mods have final say on what content stays or goes. Pursuant to Comb. Civ. C. §22SA{g}{i} We reserve the right to ban users for making our subreddit terrible\n\n\n###**V. Kevin**\n\n1. Kevin\n\n\n###**VI. No excessive spamming**\n\n1. Pretty easy. Don't spam posts or comments. We are a shitposting sub, but we have *some*, miniscule, standards.\n\n\n###**VII. Number 7**\n\n1. A Bangledeshi 20 year old student was arrested after watching porn, stripping naked and attacking an attendant during a flight. In March 2018, shortly after the Malindo Air flight departed from Kuala Lumpur, the 20 year old started watching pornography on his laptop. As no one seemed to notice or call him out for it, the man began taking his clothes off. At the request of the cabin crew, the student put his clothes back on. But soon, he tried to hug female flight attendants.\n\n\n###**VIII. Really, seriously, don’t be a cunt**\n\n1. That whole “don’t be a cunt” thing, just don’t\n\n\n###**IX. Properly mark NSFW and spoilers**\n\n1. im at work 😡what if my boss sees boobies on my screen 🤬. \"idk if it's nsfw/a spoiler or not\" then just mark it anyways.\n\n\n###**X. Videos must not exceed 1-ish minutes**\n\n1. This is to prevent overly long videos that become a bore to have to look at.\n\n\n^Hover ^over ^the ^rules ^to ^view ^them.\n\n---\n\n#####[Reddetiquette](https://reddit.com/wiki/reddetiquette)\n\n\n[](https://discord.gg/bvNZRuKxWk)\n---","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"shitposting","header_img":null,"title":"r/shitposting","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#edeff1","icon_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ZCOugTWF3PsViiZ4kFcgnzsvgsb50jd8HfSCH_FgjB0.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"This button is called Rory.","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":true,"subscribers":2294952,"submit_text_label":"Say hello to Kevin","link_flair_position":"right","display_name_prefixed":"r/shitposting","key_color":"","name":"t5_2usxq","created":1345364538,"url":"/r/shitposting/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1345364538,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"take it easy~","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"technicallythetruth","title":"I can't quite put my finger on it... 😂🤦🏽‍♂️","ups":40965,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_3pzez/styles/communityIcon_igyxxb3m28u31.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d74bc65eee353ab2118fa4da82fbc477d0644d00","show_media":true,"description":"[](/sidebar)\n\n\nFor information that is technically true, but far from the expected answer.\n-\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* 1- No text posts with low effort truth statements.\n\n* 2- Don't post content that has been submitted in the last 3 months.\n\n* 3- Remember the human.

Post pictures of your cats, talk about cats, ask questions, get advice.\n\n**2.** We prefer that if you post photos, it be of your own cat(s) or one(s) you personally know. If clearly stated, photos of cat(s) you don't know is allowed, within reason. **Lying and claiming/posting someone else's cat is/as your own will result in an immediate ban, with no warnings given.**\n\n**3.** No NSFW content and no animal abuse/cruelty.\n\n**4.** No titles asking for upvotes (e.g. \"This cat didn't get any love in /r/aww\", \"it's my cake day\", \"my first post here\", \"any love for ...\").\n\n**5.** Links asking for funding, competition votes or advertisement will be removed (see the list of subreddits below for a possible alternative).\n\n**6.** Be civil. We have a strong, bright-line policy against insults, namecalling or harassment, and will ban you without notice for such conduct. **If a photo has a person in it along with a cat, don't even think of being creepy or rude to that person. This includes any comments on people's appearance, either positive or negative!**\n\n**7.** Do not post personal information (this includes Facebook links as it can be easily traced back).\n\n**8.** No meme, image macro, low-effort content. Original content is preferred. No image macros, memes, or similar low-effort content. You might want to check out r/MEOW_IRL and r/Catmemes for that.\n\n**9.** Recent/Egregious reposts : Repost of recent or currently popular post from another subreddit for the purpose of farming karma (Rule 10).\n\n**10.** Reposts are allowed (and crossposts are too, don't confuse them!), within reason.\n\n**11.** No posts asking what gender your cat is, ask a vet!\n\n**12.** 'Name my cat/kitten' posts are allowed, but require the correct flair + verification to ensure OC. You must set the flair of your post to 'Name Request' at the time of submission, failing to do so is in breach of this rule. Please submit your post before sending us a modmail - your submission will trigger an automated message which will contain the instructions required for your post to be approved.Your verification message will be left unanswered if you send us a modmail before you have submitted your post for us to review.\n\n\n**13.** Mourning (RIP) posts are allowed. If you do not wish to see them, there are several filters in the sidebar to prevent them from appearing to you.\n\n\n**14.** Merchandise posts are an instant, unreversable bannable offense. No, we don't care if you've contributed to the subreddit before or not. Post any merchandise, you will be banned forever and we will not reverse it.
