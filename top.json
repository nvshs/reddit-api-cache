Do not alter headlines; copy and paste. | The title of all submissions needs to match the article headline exactly.  **Copy and paste** from the main headline only, do not include anything beyond the primary headline such as byliners, subtitles, flavor text, quotes from the article, news outlet, location, cross post tags, (video) tags, and so on.  Do not use the âsuggest titleâ option for posting as it often does not match the headline.  As a matter of fairness, any submission with an altered title will be removed.  The **only exception** is that, if an article has a title in **all caps**, you may change the capitalization to title case, but everything else must remain the same.|\n|2. Submit only if âOnionyâ. | Please consider submitting your article to /r/OffBeat or similar subreddits unless it truly reads like The Onion wrote it. The title and article itself must both be \"Oniony\". This can be highly subjective; you are encouraged to upvote articles that should be here and downvote those that should not.  Moderators can also remove posts at their own discretion under this rule.  [More here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/done_to_death)|\n|3. Must be a news article. | Submissions must be in the form of a news article.  Videos are only allowed if they are accompanied by a complete text article.  Editorials, blogs, twitter posts, image galleries, tabloid stories, youtube videos, meta posts, static images, articles with fewer than 5 sentences, and so forth will be removed.|\n|4. Use original, reliable sources. | Find the source of your story before you submit it, simply by checking for references or googling the subject to locate the original piece.  Websites that frequently re-host viral news stories or contain misleading information are on [automatic removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval).  Blogs are not reliable sources.|\n|5. Do not repost similar articles. | Check the sub for your story before you submit it; if itâs already here then please vote and comment there instead of posting another version.  Similar stories will be removed and frequent re-posters will lose their posting privileges.  Do not delete and repost your own submissions without approval.|\n|6. No satire articles. | Even if they are technically from a source other than _The Onion_, any article submission written as satire or even true stories written in a satirical manner are not allowed.  Please note that some major news outlets have satirical sections, such as the Borowitz Report on the New Yorker, which are also not allowed.  Meanwhile, AVClub, while owned by The Onion, is not satire and is allowed. If you'd like, you can use a tool like http://realorsatire.com/ to see if your submission is from a known satirical website.|\n|7. No tabloid journalism. | Do not post tabloid news stories, or articles that source from tabloid news outlets (TheSun, Mirror, Dailymail, People, TMZ, etc).|\n|8. No old news. | Articles need to have been written within two weeks of its submission date.|\n|9. English articles only. | Please do not post non-English articles.  Do not use google translate for submission either; rather try to find an English version of the story by a secondary source.|\n|10. No mobile versions. | If youâre using a mobile device to post a story make sure you remove any mobile identifiers (typically â.mâ or âmobileâ) from the url before submitting.|\n|11. No blocked or redirected links. | Please ensure you arenât submitting a link that utilizes a paywall or survey wall (nytimes.com, thetimes.co.uk) in order gain access to the complete article.  Do not submit links that redirect you to another site to read the article and do not submit using link shorteners either.|\n\n[](/sunburstnervous) **[Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval) to view a list of sites deemed unreliable by our moderator team.**\n\n###See [our FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/nto101) for more information on our rules. \n____\n\n###Keep all comments civil.\n\n[](/twirage) Personal attacks, racism, bigotry, homophobia, grandstanding, misinformation, conspiracy theories, etc. will not be tolerated and ***you will be banned***.\n\n[Witch hunting or brigading is not allowed.

Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule4)\n\n###5. No racism/sexism/homophobia\n* Bigotry is NOT tolerated on this subreddit. Do not post things that are racist/sexist/homophobic. Depending on the content, you may receive a ban, and your comment/submission will be removed. Again, you're not going to run up against this rule unless you attempt to do so. \n\n* **IF** a submission is a comeback due to someone being racist, that *may* be accepted. Otherwise, there is zero tolerance. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule5)\n\n\n###6. No Doxxing/brigading\n* Links to other subreddits, even np links are not allowed. Screenshots only. Screenshots from any source must obscure identifying information. The only exception is for people who are already public figures. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule6)\n\n\n###7.

Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but âfactoidâ text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11.

This is a happy place. Be respectful.\n\nComments or posts not in keeping with the tone of the sub will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nBullying, racism, homophobia and sexual comments in any form, comments or links, will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nIf the comment section gets too heated, it will get locked.\n\n###2. Audible and contagious laughing\n\nAll videos must contain contagious laughter.\n\nDo not post videos that are just funny because of a joke or a situation.\n\nAudience or edited in laughter does not count as contagious laughter.\n\nCompilations are mostly old and common reposts. Please refrain from posting them here.\n\nNo bullying or victimisation. No videos of people fighting or otherwise bad natured laughs.\n\n###3. Video length\n\nVideos must be at least 10 seconds long and have a good amount of laughing in them.\n\nIf the video is more than 1 minute long, please link directly to the specific moment when it is appropriate to start watching. Alternatively include the appropriate time code in the post title.\n\n###4. No reposts\n\nReposts may be removed to encourage fresh content.\n\nRemember to check top posts and search using keywords before you post.\n\nIt's also wise to check newest posts to see if someone has just posted the same viral video you are crossposting.\n\n###5. Post must have a proper title\n\nUse a descriptive title. Bad titles are hard to search and leads to more unnecessary reposts. Mods have the final word on what is considered a bad title.\n\nExamples of bad titles: \".\", \"title\", \"ðð\", \"funny title\", \"wait for it\", \"this made me laugh\"\n\n###6. No content promotion\n\nThis subreddit is not your personal marketing place. No spamming in general.\n\n###7. No politics\n\nPolitical videos and arguments are not allowed and will be removed.

It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* \"oddly satisfying\" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.\n\n***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**\n\n######Rules:\n**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**\n###1)  **Banned Topics:**\nWe have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:\n\n* **Memes or image macros**\n\n* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as \"2048\", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.\n\n* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.\n\n* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).\n\n* **Compilation Albums/Videos**\n  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**\n  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).\n  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.\n\n* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.\n\n* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. \n\n###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** \nNSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (\"Say it, don't show it.\"). \n\n###3)  **Reposts:** \n**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.\n\n* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.\n\n* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as \"My...\", \"Mine...\", \"Our...\", \"We...\", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.\n\n###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** \nPlease cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.\n\n* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**\n* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)\n\n###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**\n\n* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: \n  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing &amp; ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.\n\n###8) **Reddiquette, Comments &amp; Subreddit Behavior:**\n\n* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.\n* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.\n* The definition of what truly is \"Oddly Satisfying\" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.\n\n###9) **Crossposts**\n* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma. \n\n#####Related subreddits:\n* /r/ArtisanVideos \n\n* /r/asmr \n\n* /r/clonedgif \n\n* /r/interestingasfuck \n\n* /r/knolling \n\n* /r/loadingicon \n\n* /r/lookscool \n\n* /r/mesmerizinggifs \n\n* /r/mildlyinfuriating \n\n* /r/mildlyinteresting \n\n* r/OrganizationPorn \n\n* /r/parasnailing \n\n* /r/perfectfit \n\n* /r/perfectLoops \n\n* /r/pic \n\n* /r/powerwashingporn \n\n* /r/satisfyinggrass\n\n* /r/showerthoughts \n\n* /r/simulated \n\n* /r/slightlyunsatisfying \n\n* /r/SlyGifs   \n\n* /r/ThatPeelingFeeling\n\n* /r/ThisBlewMyMind \n\n* /r/WtWFotMJaJtRAtCaB [SFW]","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"oddlysatisfying","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6NYespd3jy62IgAehgvHjNFg8z9zBIlFefIn2ZrF5oQ.png","title":"Oddly Satisfying","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#00a6a5","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/65GJujMgAXbydbxxFPYm6eck1YffqR-anhX4-hxnVhQ.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[115,120],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9221275,"submit_text_label":"Texty-text text","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/oddlysatisfying","key_color":"#ff66ac","name":"t5_2x93b","created":1368595528,"url":"/r/oddlysatisfying/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1368595528,"banner_size":[1280,384],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"For those little things that are inexplicably satisfying.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"worldnews","title":"Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark struck a deal to run their 200+ advanced fighter jets as a single fleet, creating a new headache for Russia","ups":50243,"post_hint":"link","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2qh13/styles/communityIcon_pldiwqvsyns91.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3088f291b089bb5bc15599d429a759b258c6cbd5","show_media":false,"description":"&gt;&gt;&gt; - **Other Subs:**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; - [Related](http://goo.gl/ztbbza)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/News\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/PoliticalDiscussion\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/WorldEvents\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/GeoPolitics\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/IntheNews\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/GlobalTalk \n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/Breakingnews \n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/Business\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/Economics\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/Environment\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/History\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/HumanRights\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/Features\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/UpliftingNews\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/NewsOfTheWeird\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/FakeNews\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/ID_News \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; - [N.
