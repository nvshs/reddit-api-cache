Violation of this rule may result in a ban\n\n2. **Posts must depict humans actually being bros.** Please do not post humans engaging in normal human behavior which might simply appeal to humans.\n\n3. **No reliance on additional context.**  The 'bro' action should be easily discernible within the image/gif/video. Having to add context in the title, comments, super-imposed text or otherwise to explain the 'bro' is against sub rules.  Submissions violating this rule will be removed\n\n4. **No reposts.** All reposts are removed at moderators discretion.  Repost farming is not allowed and will result in a ban.  Check the sub prior to posting to see if your submission has already been posted\n\n5.  **NSFW content.** NSFW content is sometimes okay here, but it must be flagged appropriately.  We do not allow any content related to suicide, or suicide prevention.  No rage bait submissions.  Any content that is sexually suggestive or contains drug use is grounds for a permanent ban\n\n6. **No Spam.** Original content and crossposts from other subreddits are welcome, but we do not allow posts promoting a specific website, YouTube channel, blog, subreddit etc. Such posts will be removed, reported as spam, and you will be banned. Creating a post for the sole purpose to redirect to another subreddit will be removed as spam\n\n7. **No staged submissions.** Scenes set up to look helpful are staged and will be removed.  Staged videos made by content creators for clout on TikTok, YouTube or Instagram will also be removed at moderators discretion.  No poverty porn or exploitative media.  We do not allow skits or social experiment videos.\n\n8. **No memes, comics, or compilations.** Refrain from posting jokes, memes, puns, reaction gifs and wordplays. No compilation videos, gifs, pictures, etc.\n\n9. **No Fundraising/Request/Donation Posts.** This includes any post or comment asking for people to perform a 'bro' action. Examples include: attending funerals, mailing cards, petitions, joining livestreams, and GoFundMe campaigns. Moderators will ban those violating this rule.\n\n10. **No spreading misinformation.** Sharing a source and debating that source or topic in a fair and reasonable manner (i.e., without personal attacks) is encouraged. Do not make wildly unsubstantiated and/or outlandish claims without the ability to share a source.\n\n11. **No posts or comments directly about politics and no bringing politics into a post or comment not about politics.  No war related content.  No posts centered around police**\n\n12.  **No text only submissions.** This includes screenshots of text messages, twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Reddit screenshots from other communities will be reviewed on a case by case basis.  Images of text are prohibited.  This includes:  cards, letters, notes. \n\n13. **No slurs, harassing or trolling comments.  No racial slurs or sexually inappropriate comments.

No [Bad Faith Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/wiki/bfp).\n \n3.) No bullying or witch-hunting. This includes comments disparaging people whose tweets and posts are featured here. Doxxing or sharing personal information will result in a permanent ban. \n \n4.) **No Racism**. No hate speech. No homophobia/transphobia. No sexism/misogyny. No black fathers posts and similar mean-spirited things.\n \n5.) **Posts must be showcasing somebody being hilarious or insightful on social media**. No image macros, text conversations, or YouTube links. Just because somebody posted one of these on social media does not exempt it from this rule. Vines and such belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleVines/) and gifs belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackpeoplegifs).\n\n6.) Typical Reddit cliches such as **lyric chains**, **pun chains**, white-knighting, and low-effort joke comments will be removed. Same for [annoying redditisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/8ezy45/an_update_for_some_of_the_rules_bad_faith/dxzhp13/), such as linking a subreddit as a reply to a post/comment.\n\n7.) **Reposts are highly discouraged, and if discovered will be removed**. Please search or look through BPT's older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts.\n\n8.) No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you think of something acceptable/reasonable. **Don't put the punchline in the title of the post**. Do not add \"bruh\", \"fam\", or similar vernacular to your post or comment.\n\n9.) Don't complain about [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) or slang. Use [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com) if you do not understand the meaning of a word. Comments asking \"what does x mean?\" will be removed. \n\n\n10.) BPT is an inclusive space for POC and allies alike.  This sub highlights minority viewpoints, through humor, commentary, or criticism.  Please respect these voices and show you care about black opinions as much as you care about black humor.\n \n11.) Don't post things from meme/corporate accounts. Posts must come from regular social media accounts.  \n\n12.) **The moderators of this subreddit will take any action (which includes banning and removing comments) that they feel improves the quality of the subreddit.**\n\n---\n\n---\n\n‚òëÔ∏è**Friends**‚òëÔ∏è\n\n* /r/BPTmeta\n\n* /r/blackpeoplegifs \n\n* /r/wholesomebpt\n\n* /r/memesofanime\n\n* /r/bestoftwitter\n\n* /r/WhitePeopleFacebook \n\n* /r/indianpeoplefacebook\n\n* /r/oldpeoplefacebook\n\n* /r/blackpeoplevines\n\n* /r/bptcirclejerk\n\n* /r/LatinoPeopleTwitter\n\n* /r/BikiniBottomTwitter \n\n* /r/NSFWTwitterReplies\n\n* /r/saiyanpeopletwitter","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"BlackPeopleTwitter","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/sT2axkkgWgb6V5rO35En_dRy6FUwCosDH0FQtoWa_EA.png","title":"Black Twitter","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#ffffff","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/goztKoS6PTNQClaez3bF9leosspey2xXCOv0DSxNG2Q.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[100,109],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":5636940,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/BlackPeopleTwitter","key_color":"#24a0ed","name":"t5_33x33","created":1412734504,"url":"/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1412734504,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Screenshots of Black people being hilarious or insightful on social media, it doesn't need to just be twitter but obviously that is best.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"ContagiousLaughter","title":"Risky joke with the cops","ups":35350,"post_hint":"hosted:video","media":{"reddit_video":{"bitrate_kbps":600,"fallback_url":"https://v.redd.it/65bqwjp1adta1/DASH_240.mp4?source=fallback","height":240,"width":336,"scrubber_media_url":"https://v.redd.it/65bqwjp1adta1/DASH_96.mp4","dash_url":"https://v.redd.it/65bqwjp1adta1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1683918002%2CYjcxZDBlYWNiYTIxNWNjNmFjNDVlODdiMjYwOGFjZWZiNTQ4MzFhMTRmY2ExZThkNWE3OTlhNGFiY2NiZDViNw%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","duration":8,"hls_url":"https://v.redd.it/65bqwjp1adta1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1683918002%2CMTBlMjZlMjFkZmI3MWE2YjVhZTM5YmU0MTlhOGI3NWVlNTU0NDAyNTUwYzM3NTk1ZDQyMTgzYjA2MmFhNGVjYw%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","is_gif":false,"transcoding_status":"completed"}},"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":["giphy"],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2u2bh/styles/communityIcon_9inc3hztotg91.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=34cbe966e07792dbf7b38dbdb77d01066ecf245d","show_media":true,"description":"**Videos of people laughing infectiously.

This is a happy place. Be respectful.\n\nComments or posts not in keeping with the tone of the sub will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nBullying, racism, homophobia and sexual comments in any form, comments or links, will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nIf the comment section gets too heated, it will get locked.\n\n###2. Audible and contagious laughing\n\nAll videos must contain contagious laughter.\n\nDo not post videos that are just funny because of a joke or a situation.\n\nAudience or edited in laughter does not count as contagious laughter.\n\nCompilations are mostly old and common reposts. Please refrain from posting them here.\n\nNo bullying or victimisation. No videos of people fighting or otherwise bad natured laughs.\n\n###3. Video length\n\nVideos must be at least 10 seconds long and have a good amount of laughing in them.\n\nIf the video is more than 1 minute long, please link directly to the specific moment when it is appropriate to start watching. Alternatively include the appropriate time code in the post title.\n\n###4. No reposts\n\nReposts may be removed to encourage fresh content.\n\nRemember to check top posts and search using keywords before you post.\n\nIt's also wise to check newest posts to see if someone has just posted the same viral video you are crossposting.\n\n###5. Post must have a proper title\n\nUse a descriptive title. Bad titles are hard to search and leads to more unnecessary reposts. Mods have the final word on what is considered a bad title.\n\nExamples of bad titles: \".\", \"title\", \"üòÇüòÇ\", \"funny title\", \"wait for it\", \"this made me laugh\"\n\n###6. No content promotion\n\nThis subreddit is not your personal marketing place. No spamming in general.\n\n###7. No politics\n\nPolitical videos and arguments are not allowed and will be removed. Let's keep this sub politics free.","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"ContagiousLaughter","header_img":null,"title":"Contagious Laughter","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-aRiAKQyfxSEA8u0R1bBaiIaeXH0xBsJvGkNnKwTpiE.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a new video","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":6306036,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/ContagiousLaughter","key_color":"#ddbd37","name":"t5_2u2bh","created":1336564914,"url":"/r/ContagiousLaughter/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1336564914,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Something to put you in a good mood.\n\nVideos of people laughing infectiously.
