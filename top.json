No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.\n\nSaturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)\n\n##Rules:\n\n1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11. Submissions must fit the purpose of the community. /r/PublicFreakout is a subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public.\n\n[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.\n](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)\n\n##Tags:\n\n**[Mod's Choice]** - The mark of a good find and a quality freakout\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:Top**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=all)\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:New**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all)\n\nUsers who submit a \"Mod's Choice\" qualify for permanent custom user flair.
