Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

Submissions\r\n\r\n* ####Guidelines:\r\n\r\n* Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology\r\n\r\n* [Self posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/wiki/self-post-guide) must contribute positively to /r/technology and foster reasonable discussion. Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable.\r\n\r\n* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions in the technological world.\r\n\r\n* ####Please do not submit the following:\r\n\r\n* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.\r\n\r\n* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. \r\n\r\n* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).\r\n\r\n* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.\r\n\r\n* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).\r\n\r\n* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.\r\n\r\n* vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.\r\n\r\n* viii) Social media links/profiles/invites or promotions (eg. Facebook, Instagram, Pintrest etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. \r\n\r\n##2. Behaviour\r\n\r\n* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, trolling or bigotry in any form are therefore not allowed and will be removed. Repeated abuse can result in a permanent ban.\r\n\r\n##3. Titles\r\n\r\n* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote, which must:\r\n\r\n* adequately describe the content\r\n\r\n* adequately describe the content's relation to technology\r\n\r\n* be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning. \r\n\r\n##4. Flair\r\n\r\n* Please flair your submission appropriately. [An extended guide to flairing can be found here, in the wiki](/r/technology/wiki/flair).\r\n\r\n##5. Reddit-wide rules.\r\n\r\n* [All reddit-wide rules apply here](/rules). Do not [spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F). No Self Promotion.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n##Miscellanea\r\n\r\n* If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) with your reason.\r\n\r\n* Want to host an AMA? Please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).\r\n\r\n* Our /u/AutoModerator configuration may be viewed [here](https://imgur.com/a/EOi0n). \r\n\r\n* Removed posts will either be given a removal reason flair and/or comment response; please message the moderators if this did not occur.\r\n\r\n* All legitimate, answerable modmail inquiries or suggestions will be answered to the best of our abilities within a reasonable period of time. \r\n\r\n#Related Subreddits\r\n\r\n## Technology\r\n\r\n* /r/AskTechnology\r\n* /r/Futurology\r\n* /r/Gadgets\r\n* /r/Hardware\r\n* /r/Tech\r\n* /r/Technews\r\n* /r/Realtech\r\n* /r/PCMasterRace\r\n* /r/BuildAPC\r\n* /r/BuildAPCSales\r\n* /r/InternetIsBeautiful \r\n* /r/RenewableEnergy\r\n* /r/SelfDrivingCars\r\n* /r/TechSupport\r\n* /r/TalesFromTechSupport\r\n* /r/TechSupportGore\r\n* /r/TechnologyPorn\r\n* /r/ImaginaryTechnology\r\n* /r/Kickstarter\r\n* /r/Homeautomation\r\n* /r/Artificial\r\n\r\n##PROGRAMMING\r\n\r\n* /r/Programming\r\n* /r/Learnprogramming\r\n* [Language-Specific Communities](/r/programming/wiki/faq#wiki_what_language_reddits_are_there.3F)\r\n* /r/CScareerquestions\r\n* /r/CompSci\r\n* /r/NetSec\r\n* /r/Engineering\r\n* /r/Hacking\r\n\r\n\r\n##OS's\r\n\r\n* /r/Windows\r\n* /r/OSX\r\n* /r/Linux\r\n* /r/Ubuntu\r\n* /r/Debian\r\n* /r/Archlinux\r\n* /r/Raspberry_pi\r\n* /r/Chromeos\r\n* /r/ReactOS\r\n* /r/RemixOS\r\n* /r/Android\r\n* /r/iOS\r\n* /r/Jailbreak\r\n* /r/LineageOS\r\n\r\n##SOFTWARE\r\n\r\n* /r/Software\r\n* /r/Firefox\r\n* /r/Chrome\r\n* /r/Photoshop \r\n* /r/Kodi \r\n\r\n##POPULAR COMPANIES\r\n\r\n* /r/Google\r\n* /r/Microsoft\r\n* /r/Apple\r\n* /r/Amazon\r\n* /r/Startups\r\n\r\n##CRYPTOCURRENCIES\r\n\r\n* /r/CryptoCurrency\r\n* /r/Ethereum\r\n* /r/BTC\r\n* /r/Bitcoin\r\n\r\n##CAMPAIGNS\r\n\r\n* /r/KeepOurNetFree \r\n* /r/Pirateparty \r\n* /r/Privacy","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"technology","header_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/VwBugImhQhFTJhC0HjM9IWyEEEF898HHtI2AunD5SW4.png","title":"/r/Technology ","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/J_fCwTYJkoM-way-eaOHv8AOHoF_jNXNqOvPrQ7bINY.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[40,61],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":14115242,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/technology","key_color":"#0dd3bb","name":"t5_2qh16","created":1201231675,"url":"/r/technology/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1201231675,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Subreddit dedicated to the news and discussions about the creation and use of technology and its surrounding issues.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}}]
