No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned.

If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

No related posts\n&gt; Posts that acknowledge, \"one-up,\" or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. \"I see your X and raise you Y\")\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###3.

Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n&gt; **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n&gt; **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image.

Read [the subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/wiki/index) for more information about the subreddit.\n\n\n##[General Conduct](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_general_conduct)\n\n&gt; 1. **[Don't complain about comics you don't like or understand.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_1._don.27t_complain_about_comics_you_don.27t_like.)** - If you don't get a comic, it's probably not meant for you. Comics are often targeted at certain audiences. If you don't get a comic, odds are it wasn't meant for you. Don't whine about it; just move on to the next comic.\n2. **[Don't attack artists posting their content.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_2._don.27t_attack_artists_posting_their_content)** - It's not ok to attack artists with hateful comments meant to tear them down or try to chase them off Reddit. \n3. **[Don't make drama for drama's sake. No trolling.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_3._don.27t_make_drama_for_drama.27s_sake._no_trolling.)** - Anyone wanting to participate in this community needs to keep their comments civil.  No hateful comments or posts - Any comments or posts that are racist, mysogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, misinformation or extremist in nature will be removed and will result in an immediate ban.\n4. **[Respect the [OC] System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_4._respect_the_.5Boc.5D_system)** - The [OC] tag is for artists wanting to submit their Original Content.  False claims on others' art will get you banned.\n5. **[Respect the Report System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_5._respect_the_report_system)** - Reports are for content that breaks this sub's/Reddit's rules.  False reports are given to the Reddit Admins. \n6. **[Tag NSFW content when needed.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_6._tag_nsfw_content_when_needed.)** - Content with nudity, pornography, or obvious profanity should be tagged as NSFW.  \n\n##[What is OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_ok_to_post)\n\n&gt; * **Comic covers or short excerpts** - *A few* scanned pages can be posted for discussion.  Don't post entire comic books.  Posts with too many pages will get removed.\n* **Web comic strips** - Most strips need to be linked back to original sources (i.e. the artists' websites).   Don't link to [rehosted](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_rehosting) or [hotlinked](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_hotlinking) comics. Artists can use [OC] to link to their own work anywhere.\n* **Links to articles, videos, art, cosplay or music** - Content directly related to comic books or web comics, including film and TV media.  \n* **Discussion topics** - Talk about past or present comic books or strips.  Topics about comic-based movies or TV shows are also fine.\n* **Translations** - English translations of non-English original comics are ok as long as the translation is honest and a link to the original source is provided in a comment.\n\n##[What is not OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_not_ok_to_post)\n\n&gt; * **Edits to comics that you didn't make** - Don't remove watermarks/attribution or try to \"fix\" someone else's work.  Post your own original content.\n* **Stuff that just reminds you of comics without there being any real reference in the topic** - Please keep posts on topic with real comic content.\n* **Links to download complete, pirated comic books** - Please support comics by buying them.\n\n\n##[Are You A Comic Artist?](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_are_you_a_comic_artist.3F)\n\n&gt; Content creators can get Artist Flair to display next to their account names on all of their posts. [Message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FComics) with some proof and the name of your strip for some blue flair.  Artists without flair can add [OC] to post titles to identify their \"Original Content.\" Tagging a post with [OC] allows links to general hosting sites like Imgur.\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp;\n    \n&gt; [ ](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23comics \"flair-talk\")\n\n##Related Subreddits\n\n&gt; * /r/comicbooks\n* /r/webcomics\n* /r/manga\n* /r/graphicnovels\n* /r/comicbookart\n* /r/comiccon\n* /r/comic_crits\n* /r/wholesomecomics \n* /r/webtoons \n* /r/comicbookshelves.\n* [Marvel Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/marvel)\n* [DC Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/dc)\n* [Image Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/image)\n* [Vertigo Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/vertigo)\n* [Dark Horse Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/darkhorse)\n* [Valiant Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/valiant)\n* [Manga Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/manga)\n* [Other Comics-Related Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/other)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"comics","header_img":"https://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/uIbyX8MSVa0J6mKV.png","title":"Print Comics and Webcomics ","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":null,"primary_color":"","icon_img":"","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[175,40],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":2135052,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/comics","key_color":"#0079d3","name":"t5_2qh0s","created":1201219852,"url":"/r/comics/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1201219852,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Everything related to print comics (comic books, graphic novels, and strips) and web comics.

If you disagree with this, take it up with the admins, because we have no say in them.\n\n\n###**II. Don't be a cunt**\n\n1. Also simple. If you come to this sub to be a cunt and to argue about politics, religion, etc in an uncivil way, then you will be banned. This is a shitposting sub dammit, not r/politics.\n\n\n###**III. Shitposts üòÉ God awful posts üò°**\n\n1. This subreddit is for shitposts, not gawdawfulposts. and yes, repost chains/blatant karmawhoring posts are godawfulposts, not shitposts.

In March 2018, shortly after the Malindo Air flight departed from Kuala Lumpur, the 20 year old started watching pornography on his laptop. As no one seemed to notice or call him out for it, the man began taking his clothes off. At the request of the cabin crew, the student put his clothes back on. But soon, he tried to hug female flight attendants.\n\n\n###**VIII. Really, seriously, don‚Äôt be a cunt**\n\n1. That whole ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be a cunt‚Äù thing, just don‚Äôt\n\n\n###**IX. Properly mark NSFW and spoilers**\n\n1. im at work üò°what if my boss sees boobies on my screen ü§¨. \"idk if it's nsfw/a spoiler or not\" then just mark it anyways.\n\n\n###**X.

Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

Our sub is intended as family-friendly, so you are encouraged and required to be kind to others. Insults, attacks, flaming, hate speech, and general unkindness will not be tolerated. **Depending on severity, this may lead to a ban.**\n\n2. **No references to or depictions of harm** \n\n Any reference to harming animals, or an animal harming others, is not tolerated. Note: this includes references towards eating the subject of the photo, e.g. a pig or cow. **This rule is strictly enforced, and violations will often lead to a permanent ban.** Not knowing of this rule is not a valid reason for removing your ban. **Animals that are obese to the point of abuse will also be removed.**\n\n3. **All animals are allowed, but your post MUST contain an animal, and the animal must be the focus.**\n\n While our sub is based on puppers, **we allow any sort of animal**, as long as it's cute! However, **your post must contain an animal**. Posts consisting only of collars, stickers, t-shirts, human children, etc, will be removed. Art is allowed, but the post must contain a photo of the animal in question. **Posts that are primarily human-focused (including babies) will be removed** - no selfies with a small blurry dog in the corner.\n\n4. **No swearing, the puppers don't like. [Includes soft swearing]** \n\n Our commitment to kindness and family friendly atmosphere means that we do not allow swear words of any kind on the sub, regardless of strength. All swears must be replaced by alternatives like 'heck, 'gosh', 'dang', etc. Alternatively, consider rewording your sentence to not need it at all. \nNote: \"Soft swearing\", such as b\\*\\*k, b%&amp;k, or b0rk, is equally disallowed.\n**Attempts to intentionally evade the swear filter will result in a ban.**\n\n5. **Put effort into your post. No asking for upvotes or \"Reddit, meet X\" titles.** \n\n Rarepuppers originated as a fun place to share silly pictures of animols, including doggos, with some silly title. We want to know what makes the animol you are sharing fun, unique, or interesting! Merely stating your pet's name, age, and/or breed isn't enough. An easy way to fulfill this rule is by telling us about a fun personality quirk your pet has, or about something cute or fun they did recently.  \n\n Posts asking to identify a breed, or requesting name ideas, are disallowed as such posts tend to flood the subreddit if not removed. Asking for upvotes/comments is also not allowed.\n\n6. **Keep it positive. No sad content and grief threads.** \n\n Rarepuppers aims to be a fun, happy place where viewers can see cute, silly content. **Stories of abuse, death, or violence towards animals, while important to bring awareness to, are not a good fit for this sub.** Other communities, such as /r/PetLoss and /r/OldManDog are a better fit for posts about losing your companion. If you really wish to share your pet here in their final days, please don't mention the end of their life in your title.\n\n7. **OC is preferred. Stolen content is not allowed.** \n\n Our favorite posts are those that come from you! We often pin new OC to the front page each day, and we love seeing photos of your pets and animals. To this end, **we disallow any sort of stolen content, or highly crossposted content**. This includes screenshots of Twitter posts, word-for-word reposts from /r/aww, and other such cases. **Exact letter-for-letter reposts will lead to a ban.**\n\n8. **Frequent and recent reposts are discouraged.** \n\n **If the photo you'd like to post has been shared in the last few weeks, or just a lot in general, we may remove it.** Any post on our top all time will also be removed. New and fresh content is important on our sub.\n\n9. **Politics, as well as military or police animals, are not allowed.**\n\n Due to causing far more trouble than it's worth for a sub of this nature, **discussion of politics is not permitted on this sub, and will be removed**. Once again, this includes in the context of a joke. For this same reason, **we do not allow posts of dogs or animals in the service of the police or military**.\n\n10. **Puppertalk is encouraged and welcomed, complaints about it are not.** \n\n We get that not everybody likes our lingo, and that's fine. There are many other animal themed subs for you to browse, and we're totally okay with you steering clear of us. However, this does not give you a license to be rude to our users about how they speak. **Complaints and high-horsing about spelling and pupperspeak will be removed and may lead to a ban.** Just ignore it and go somewhere else.\n\n11. **No adult content. This is a family friendly sub.**\n\n We do not accept adult content. Sexual references, drug references, and other content of this type will be removed, even implied or in the context of a joke.\n\n12. **No breed-shaming.** \n\n Doggos and other pets come in all sorts of breeds. Some are healthier than others, but nevertheless, they are all deserving of love and attention! While we don't condone unhealthy breeding practices, we don't disallow sharing content based on the breed of the animal. This also applies to breeds that are commonly seen as dangerous (e.g. pit bulls). **Due to persistent brigading, anti-pit bull comments are moderated very strictly and will result in a permanent ban.**\n\n13. **Limit of three posts per user per day.** \n\n Do not post more than 3 posts in a 24 hour period of time, this will be considered spam. If you have many related pictures to share, it may be a good idea to post them as a single gallery, instead of separately. Making more than three posts in a 24-hour period is considered spamming.\n\n\n***\n\nPlease remember that this subreddit is not the place to ask for / give medical advice. **Please talk to a veterinarian if your pet is sick.**\n\n***\n\n**[This subreddit stands against hate speech](http://redd.it/3djkz4)**\n\n***\n\n**TERMINOLOGY: [Check out the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/index#wiki_terminology_and_all_that_jazz)**\n***\n#similar subreddits:\n\nwould you like a subreddit featured? send a modmail!\n\n***\n\n#[General cuteness](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_general_cuteness)\n---\n\n#[Puppers](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_puppers)\n---\n\n#[cates](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_cates)\n---\n\n#[birbs](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_birbs)\n\n---\n\n#[turtles](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_turts)\n\n---\n\n#[ottos](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_ottos)\n\n---\n\n#[wabbits](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_wabbits)\n\n---\n\n#[scalie frens](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_scalie_frens)\n\n---\n\n#[big boyes](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_big_boyes)\n\n---\n\n# [other animols](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_other_animols)\n\n---\n\n#[Other non-animol frens](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/wiki/friendos#wiki_non_animol_frens)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"rarepuppers","header_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Eca856xlPlLTmedym1pRV35rNtWaRs8O22tOy3X_ob0.png","title":"woofe woofe whats for lumch haha","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#cc5289","icon_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/vgsdeI9NEO30dWRjRJ8uI91pq3iqG-WhoND9XrBvY_4.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"post a pup or an animol","header_size":[2500,300],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":4691778,"submit_text_label":"no","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/rarepuppers","key_color":"#ff66ac","name":"t5_3b749","created":1449460947,"url":"/r/rarepuppers/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1449460947,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"This is a subreddit devoted to cute little animols such as puppers, cates and turtols, and all sorts of other cute animols :)","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"MadeMeSmile","title":"Respect at a high","ups":44301,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2uqcm/styles/communityIcon_kfqpkjbvpv001.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=01612176bef55554664a2909df8190aff3b8353c","show_media":true,"description":"[**New to reddit?
