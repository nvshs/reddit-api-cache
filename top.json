This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).\n####What does \"Oddly Satisfying\" mean?\nWe are forever searching for a \"true definition\". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* \"oddly satisfying\" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.\n\n***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**\n\n######Rules:\n**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**\n###1)  **Banned Topics:**\nWe have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:\n\n* **Memes or image macros**\n\n* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as \"2048\", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.\n\n* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.\n\n* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).\n\n* **Compilation Albums/Videos**\n  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**\n  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).\n  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.\n\n* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.\n\n* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. \n\n###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** \nNSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (\"Say it, don't show it.\"). \n\n###3)  **Reposts:** \n**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.\n\n* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.\n\n* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as \"My...\", \"Mine...\", \"Our...\", \"We...\", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.\n\n###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** \nPlease cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.\n\n* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**\n* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)\n\n###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**\n\n* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: \n  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing &amp; ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.\n\n###8) **Reddiquette, Comments &amp; Subreddit Behavior:**\n\n* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.\n* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.\n* The definition of what truly is \"Oddly Satisfying\" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.\n\n###9) **Crossposts**\n* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma. \n\n#####Related subreddits:\n* /r/ArtisanVideos \n\n* /r/asmr \n\n* /r/clonedgif \n\n* /r/interestingasfuck \n\n* /r/knolling \n\n* /r/loadingicon \n\n* /r/lookscool \n\n* /r/mesmerizinggifs \n\n* /r/mildlyinfuriating \n\n* /r/mildlyinteresting \n\n* r/OrganizationPorn \n\n* /r/parasnailing \n\n* /r/perfectfit \n\n* /r/perfectLoops \n\n* /r/pic \n\n* /r/powerwashingporn \n\n* /r/satisfyinggrass\n\n* /r/showerthoughts \n\n* /r/simulated \n\n* /r/slightlyunsatisfying \n\n* /r/SlyGifs   \n\n* /r/ThatPeelingFeeling\n\n* /r/ThisBlewMyMind \n\n* /r/WtWFotMJaJtRAtCaB [SFW]","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"oddlysatisfying","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6NYespd3jy62IgAehgvHjNFg8z9zBIlFefIn2ZrF5oQ.png","title":"Oddly Satisfying","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#00a6a5","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/65GJujMgAXbydbxxFPYm6eck1YffqR-anhX4-hxnVhQ.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[115,120],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9357072,"submit_text_label":"Texty-text text","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/oddlysatisfying","key_color":"#ff66ac","name":"t5_2x93b","created":1368595528,"url":"/r/oddlysatisfying/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1368595528,"banner_size":[1280,384],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"For those little things that are inexplicably satisfying.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"PeopleFuckingDying","title":"kItTy PhYsIcAlLy AnD vErBaLlY AtTaCkS rEtAiL wOrKeR","ups":62728,"post_hint":"hosted:video","media":{"reddit_video":{"bitrate_kbps":2400,"fallback_url":"https://v.redd.it/4bgth28h3ava1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback","height":720,"width":406,"scrubber_media_url":"https://v.redd.it/4bgth28h3ava1/DASH_96.mp4","dash_url":"https://v.redd.it/4bgth28h3ava1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1684731603%2CYTJjY2NmODMxYjU4N2JkNmUxMjAwZjhlYjNjNzExMzIyN2ViNWE2NmViNmUwNjI5MzhkYTk4YzI4MDlhNWUwZA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","duration":23,"hls_url":"https://v.redd.it/4bgth28h3ava1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1684731603%2CNWM0YmNmYmQwN2ExZTNmYmVhZmEyYTIwMTI3N2U1MGFlYTNiMjc3ZmNhZThiOTA0ZDAzNDIxMzQ0MTkyNmM4Mw%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","is_gif":false,"transcoding_status":"completed"}},"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":["giphy","static"],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":null,"show_media":true,"description":"***This subreddit is intended for short videos, gifs and pictures that depict an action, which is exaggerated or subverted by the title of the post.***\n\n***[See our all-time top posts for examples.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeopleFuckingDying/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all)***\n\n***Moderators reserve the right to remove posts for quality control.***\n\n##▼ Rules\n\n* ##### 1.

Don't be a dick\nIt's not hard, just be nice to each other.\n\n###2. No hateful insults\nDon't post hateful insults\n\n###3. No reposts\nDon't repost. Please refer to our [common repost album.](https://imgur.com/a/8XDVQtt)\n\n###4. Not a rare insult/threat\n/r/rareinsults is not for unfunny/common insults, this includes insults that follow the random [adjective]+[noun] formula. It is only for rare insults. No other post types are allowed\n\nCorporate insults also fall under this category. [Click here to learn more!](https://redd.it/ghj57g)\n\n###5. No personal information\nPersonal information includes full names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, and usernames\n\n###6. No politics\nPolitical submissions will be removed and posters will be permanently banned.\n\nThis includes mention of politicians, political commentators, and political movements\n\n###7. All posts require a proper title\nNo low effort titles or titles that contain the insult. Examples are \"for those sorting by new\" or \"lmao he called this dude a deformed shrimp.\"\n\nIf your post is removed for another reason and you repost, do not title your post \"reposting because it was removed.\"\n\n###8. No long videos (&gt;10s) or long texts\nDon't post long videos and don't post long texts. If the entirety of the long text is an insult, then it belongs on /r/murderedbywords, and if it is a long text with only a small insult buried inside the text, it will be removed.\n\n###9. No image macros/memes\nPosting memes or images with text on them(image macros) aren't allowed as they detract from the main point of the subreddit, which is rare insults. Memes are off-topic and belong in other subreddits.\n\n###10. No crossposts\n\n###11. No r/RoastMe\nInsults from r/RoastMe are not allowed, as people have time to sit and think of clever insults rather than coming up with them in the moment.\n\n###12. Moderators' Discretion\n\nModerators reserve the right to remove any post they deem unfit for the subreddit, even if it doesn't explicitly break any rules. This rule will only be used in specific ways, such as one/two word posts, posts in different languages, etc. This is extremely subjective and mostly up to the judgement of the mods using it, so if you disagree with this rule being used to remove your post, let us know using [modmail](/message/compose/?to=/r/rareinsults)\n\n[](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"rareinsults","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Zhwk3hcVO2qCD3oL6A6oYdskQzcwGKQUNRGa4clt4Tg.png","title":"r/RareInsults","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#7193ff","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wWCY2qH6nBLeYtLIxWMMSzNKNVAgZqoGnsBQTV4RwWs.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a rare insult","header_size":[96,96],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":2348803,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/rareinsults","key_color":"#ff4500","name":"t5_48t85","created":1510880378,"url":"/r/rareinsults/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1510880378,"banner_size":[735,220],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Did you stumble across a unique insult?
