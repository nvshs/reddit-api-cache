Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

We have cookies and UNLIMITED POWER!\n\n###[discord](https://discord.gg/msnKMcPq2p)\n\n*****\n\nDid you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.\n*****\n*****\n\n\n##Rules:\n\n##1. No metagaming\n\n##2. Don't be an asshole\n\n##3. Posts must be memes of the Star Wars Prequels.\n\n##4. Posts inappropriate for viewing in public, like at work, must be tagged NSFW.\n\n##5. No politics.\n\n##6. No edgy or inflammatory posts.\n\n##7. No brigading/encouraging brigading.\n\n##8. No encouraging subreddit drama.\n\n##9. No annoying bots or novelty accounts\n\n##10. No short-term reposts\n\n##11. No low-effort posts\n\n##12. No promotion\n\n##13. No misinformation\n\n##14. No spam\n\n*****\n\n##Details: \n\n1\\. No upvote/karma/awards/subscriber related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban. Cakeday posts also fall under this rule.\n\n2\\. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc. This includes being aggressive or impolite to other users, most likely from some sort of disagreement. We do not care who “started it” when a pair of users are acting this way. Just report someone if they are acting that way and we will handle it.\n\n3\\. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. \"Prequel\" refers to any media that takes place before the beginning of A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas, EU content, and video games. Note that single pictures of a character (e.g. \"Just a picture of Obi-Wan\") do not necessarily count as memes, and may be seen as a violation of Rule 1. Additionally, all posts must make an attempt at humor. All posts must be made *from* prequel-content or *about* prequel content.\n\n4\\. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother. NSFW posts that are not porn should be marked as NSFW. Kids come here, use your head. If you wouldn’t be comfortable with a 12 year old on their iPad seeing your content, best to mark it NSFW to be safe. In addition to this, do not sexualize minors on this sub. Including that notorious copypasta.\n\n5\\. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. /r/PrequelMemes is meant to be a refuge from the extreme political divisiveness you see on nearly every Reddit community every day. Even if an issue seems black and white to you, it is not to be discussed on the subreddit. As a result, we don't allow anything that would bring politics in. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts related to politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics or social-issues.\n\n6\\. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. This includes those edgy memes that involve autism or school shootings. /r/PrequelMemes is about humor for everyone involved. If your humor is derived from upsetting/mocking others, probably not a good community for you. With that said, we do not simply remove every meme that someone might disagree with.\n\n7\\. Brigading, in reddit terms, is the encouragement of mass downvoting and invading of another subreddit. This is forbidden by Reddit's TOS, and, likewise, our rules. Brigading includes linking to subreddits and telling people to downvote their content. This also extends to things outside of reddit, like polls, videos, etc. Basically anything that constitutes a call to action. Brigading coordinated from /r/PrequelMemes or in the name of /r/PrequelMemes is subject to any repercussions on this sub.\n\n8\\. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start “meme wars”, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit’s mods. Very similar to rules 6 and 7, but also applies internally to causing drama in /r/PrequelMemes. Causing drama could include being intentionally aggressive to other users, baiting users into breaking rules, etc.\n\n9\\. No accounts, bot or novelty, that spam the sub or otherwise only occupy space on the sub without offering any actual merit. If your bot gets banned and you are willing to change it to meet our requirements, use mod mail to find out what needs to be changed.\n\n10\\. Here are the requirements for reposts:\n\n* Posts must be at least 6 months old before you can repost them\n\n* It also must be 6 months since the last time it was posted \n\n* All reposts must be flaired to indicate as such\n\n* OP must provide the source of the original in the comments\n\n11\\. This one is pretty simple. Post good memes that will make people laugh. Give it a good title. For the title, if you can't think of anything, slap on a loosely-related prequel quote and you are golden. Also, don’t put the caption in the title; the post must be a meme on its own if it didn’t have the title. This rule also prohibits screenshots. This includes text conversations showing someone's reaction to a meme and pictures of polls with the “I love democracy” macro slapped below it.\n\n12\\. Do not do anything that constitutes advertising or promoting anything not officially associated with the subreddit. This includes posting links to them, giving instructions on how to find them, etc. This rule generally prohibits store pages, Youtube channels, Instagram accounts, other subreddits, and discord servers, although [there are exceptions](https://old.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/wiki/rules#wiki_exceptions11)\n\n13\\. Do not convey rumors in a way that would lead people to believe they are factual. Do not spread information you know to be false. If something might not be true, make that clear in your post. This includes anything from leaks to unofficial sources of information.\n\n14\\. I cannot believe we need to make this a rule. It should be obvious. Do not post the same thing multiple times. Do not post a comment multiple times. Do not promote scams.\n\n[See the full rules, complete with examples, exceptions, and consequences, for more details.](https://old.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/wiki/rules)\n\n*****\n\nOther Star Wars Meme subs:\n\n \n\n /r/SequelMemes - /r/OTMemes - /r/The_Valkorion - /r/AnthologyMemes - /r/KOTORMemes\n\nOther Star Wars Sub Affiliations\n\n/r/StarWarsSpeculation\n\n******\nCSS by /u/Illummix\n******\nWant to use spicy emotes on this sub?

No Reposts**\nMake sure you aren't submitting a post that has already been submitted. It's a good idea to browse our top 100 posts of all time to avoid making this mistake and to familiarize yourself with the subreddit. Frequent reposting may result in a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n**2. No Advertising**\nWhile you are allowed to post your own content on this subreddit (which MUST use the flair \"OC\"), do not post videos with the title advertising your TikTok page. This includes phrases such as \"follow me, like my TikTok, etc.\" No linking your TikTok page in comments unless it is under your own video. This will result in your post/comment being immediately deleted. Blatant advertisement trying to get views or followers for yourself/others will result in a permanent ban.\n\n**3. Flair Posts Correctly**\nAll posts must be marked and flaired correctly. This makes it easier for users to sort by flair to see the content they are looking for. If a moderator feels your post is not flaired correctly, the flair may be changed or the post may be removed.\n\n**4. All Original Content MUST be Flaired as Such**\nAlong with rule 3, all original content posted MUST use the “OC” flair. We would like our users to know if you created the video you posted. This also helps prevent self advertisement and spam. Users not following this rule should be reported immediately and will receive a one month ban.\n\n**5. Posts Must Be From TikTok**\nAll posts must be directly from TikTok. This means that you can clearly see the original creator's username as well as the TikTok logo in the corner of the video. Any video with the original poster's username cut out will not be considered a TikTok. Violation of this rule may result in a temporary ban.\n\n**6. No Posting of Personal Information**\nDo not post any personal information. This includes real names, phone numbers, addresses, etc. This may result in a permanent ban.\n\n**7. Don't Witch-hunt**\nDo not call for the heads of anyone displayed in anything posted here. This will result in an immediate and permanent ban.\n\n**8. No Being Deliberately Rude, Vulgar, or Offensive to Others in Comments**\nDo not go out of your way to put down other members of the community in the comment section of a post. This may result in a permanent ban. If you see someone breaking this rule, simply report them and move on. No need to respond and get yourself banned as well.\n\n**9. Hate Speech**\nThere will be zero tolerance for explicit racism, homophobia/transphobia, or sexism/misogyny. Engaging in any sort of hate speech will result in the post or comment being removed and you will receive a permanent ban.\n\n**10. No Bad-Faith Posts Featuring Anyone Who is Mentally Ill or Disabled**\nNo content is allowed that focuses on people who are mentally ill or disabled. This will result in an immediate and permanent ban.\n\n**11. No Compilations/YouTube Video Re-uploads**\nThis is not a place to post compilations. Posting compilations may result in a permanent ban.\n\nUploading videos that are clearly YouTube videos (SNL skits, Video game highlights, etc) are not allowed. Even if you found it on TikTok, do not post ripped unedited YouTube video-TikToks here. This may result in a temporary ban.\n\n**12. Don't Complain About the Subreddit Name**\nThe subreddit evolved long ago last it's roots of \"only cringe-worthy\" content. There have been two community polls where over 85% of users agreed to include all content. It's come to the point where users who say \"This isn't cringe\" or anything of that sort, may receive a temporary ban. We have made this clear enough with a pinned comment on every single post.\n\n**13. All Political Posts MUST be Flaired as Such**\nAll political posts must be flaired as \"politics.\" Failure to do so will result in a temporary ban.\n\n**14.

This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).\n####What does \"Oddly Satisfying\" mean?\nWe are forever searching for a \"true definition\". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* \"oddly satisfying\" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.\n\n***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**\n\n######Rules:\n**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**\n###1)  **Banned Topics:**\nWe have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:\n\n* **Memes or image macros**\n\n* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as \"2048\", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.\n\n* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.\n\n* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).\n\n* **Compilation Albums/Videos**\n  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**\n  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).\n  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.\n\n* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.\n\n* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. \n\n###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** \nNSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (\"Say it, don't show it.\"). \n\n###3)  **Reposts:** \n**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.\n\n* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.\n\n* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as \"My...\", \"Mine...\", \"Our...\", \"We...\", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.\n\n###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** \nPlease cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.\n\n* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**\n* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)\n\n###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**\n\n* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: \n  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing &amp; ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.\n\n###8) **Reddiquette, Comments &amp; Subreddit Behavior:**\n\n* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.\n* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.\n* The definition of what truly is \"Oddly Satisfying\" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.\n\n###9) **Crossposts**\n* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma. \n\n#####Related subreddits:\n* /r/ArtisanVideos \n\n* /r/asmr \n\n* /r/clonedgif \n\n* /r/interestingasfuck \n\n* /r/knolling \n\n* /r/loadingicon \n\n* /r/lookscool \n\n* /r/mesmerizinggifs \n\n* /r/mildlyinfuriating \n\n* /r/mildlyinteresting \n\n* r/OrganizationPorn \n\n* /r/parasnailing \n\n* /r/perfectfit \n\n* /r/perfectLoops \n\n* /r/pic \n\n* /r/powerwashingporn \n\n* /r/satisfyinggrass\n\n* /r/showerthoughts \n\n* /r/simulated \n\n* /r/slightlyunsatisfying \n\n* /r/SlyGifs   \n\n* /r/ThatPeelingFeeling\n\n* /r/ThisBlewMyMind \n\n* /r/WtWFotMJaJtRAtCaB [SFW]","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"oddlysatisfying","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6NYespd3jy62IgAehgvHjNFg8z9zBIlFefIn2ZrF5oQ.png","title":"Oddly Satisfying","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#00a6a5","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/65GJujMgAXbydbxxFPYm6eck1YffqR-anhX4-hxnVhQ.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[115,120],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9388111,"submit_text_label":"Texty-text text","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/oddlysatisfying","key_color":"#ff66ac","name":"t5_2x93b","created":1368595528,"url":"/r/oddlysatisfying/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1368595528,"banner_size":[1280,384],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"For those little things that are inexplicably satisfying.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"Damnthatsinteresting","title":"13-year-old Michigan schoolboy steers school bus to safety after driver passes out","ups":49538,"post_hint":"hosted:video","media":{"reddit_video":{"bitrate_kbps":2400,"fallback_url":"https://v.redd.it/16fdl5jljnwa1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback","height":720,"width":720,"scrubber_media_url":"https://v.redd.it/16fdl5jljnwa1/DASH_96.mp4","dash_url":"https://v.redd.it/16fdl5jljnwa1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1685314809%2CMjc4NDUyYjE5MTljOWFiZTUwMzQ1MGVmYWRjOGRkNTdjMDZhOGY2NDllOWJhYTg2MGI3NjdkMzQ0YTg2MmM0NA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","duration":53,"hls_url":"https://v.redd.it/16fdl5jljnwa1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1685314809%2CMGFkM2FjNDVjMzI0Mjg1MDgzZTIzOTFiOGY2NzU2MDQzYTJmYzE5ZTM4OGE2YzFkNWY1NjcxYTBmZTY1Y2U1OA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","is_gif":false,"transcoding_status":"completed"}},"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PVPAHxxDZQyuSpRNyy_58hV8a5etmtYbMTfsiURAFH4.png","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":null,"show_media":true,"description":"[Image](http://www.reddit.com/r/damnthatsinteresting/search?q=flair%3A%27Image%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n[GIF](http://www.reddit.com/r/damnthatsinteresting/search?q=flair%3A%27GIF%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n[Gallery](http://www.reddit.com/r/damnthatsinteresting/search?q=flair%3A%27Gallery%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n[Video](http://www.reddit.com/r/damnthatsinteresting/search?q=flair%3A%27Video%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n[Website](http://www.reddit.com/r/damnthatsinteresting/search?q=flair%3A%27Website%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\n\n\n\n\n[New to reddit? click here!](/wiki/reddit_101)\n\n## [Rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/about/rules/)\n\n* Only \"Damnthatsinteresting\" content.
