No [Bad Faith Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/wiki/bfp).\n \n3.) No bullying or witch-hunting. This includes comments disparaging people whose tweets and posts are featured here. Doxxing or sharing personal information will result in a permanent ban. \n \n4.) **No Racism**. No hate speech. No homophobia/transphobia. No sexism/misogyny. No black fathers posts and similar mean-spirited things.\n \n5.) **Posts must be showcasing somebody being hilarious or insightful on social media**. No image macros, text conversations, or YouTube links. Just because somebody posted one of these on social media does not exempt it from this rule. Vines and such belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleVines/) and gifs belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackpeoplegifs).\n\n6.) Typical Reddit cliches such as **lyric chains**, **pun chains**, white-knighting, and low-effort joke comments will be removed. Same for [annoying redditisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/8ezy45/an_update_for_some_of_the_rules_bad_faith/dxzhp13/), such as linking a subreddit as a reply to a post/comment.\n\n7.) **Reposts are highly discouraged, and if discovered will be removed**. Please search or look through BPT's older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts.\n\n8.) No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you think of something acceptable/reasonable. **Don't put the punchline in the title of the post**. Do not add \"bruh\", \"fam\", or similar vernacular to your post or comment.\n\n9.) Don't complain about [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) or slang. Use [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com) if you do not understand the meaning of a word. Comments asking \"what does x mean?\" will be removed. \n\n\n10.) BPT is an inclusive space for POC and allies alike.  This sub highlights minority viewpoints, through humor, commentary, or criticism.  Please respect these voices and show you care about black opinions as much as you care about black humor.\n \n11.) Don't post things from meme/corporate accounts. Posts must come from regular social media accounts.  \n\n12.) **The moderators of this subreddit will take any action (which includes banning and removing comments) that they feel improves the quality of the subreddit.**\n\n---\n\n---\n\n☑️**Friends**☑️\n\n* /r/BPTmeta\n\n* /r/blackpeoplegifs \n\n* /r/wholesomebpt\n\n* /r/memesofanime\n\n* /r/bestoftwitter\n\n* /r/WhitePeopleFacebook \n\n* /r/indianpeoplefacebook\n\n* /r/oldpeoplefacebook\n\n* /r/blackpeoplevines\n\n* /r/bptcirclejerk\n\n* /r/LatinoPeopleTwitter\n\n* /r/BikiniBottomTwitter \n\n* /r/NSFWTwitterReplies\n\n* /r/saiyanpeopletwitter","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"BlackPeopleTwitter","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/sT2axkkgWgb6V5rO35En_dRy6FUwCosDH0FQtoWa_EA.png","title":"Black Twitter","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#ffffff","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/goztKoS6PTNQClaez3bF9leosspey2xXCOv0DSxNG2Q.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[100,109],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":5632555,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/BlackPeopleTwitter","key_color":"#24a0ed","name":"t5_33x33","created":1412734504,"url":"/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1412734504,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Screenshots of Black people being hilarious or insightful on social media, it doesn't need to just be twitter but obviously that is best.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"todayilearned","title":"TIL When random people of varying physical attractiveness get placed into a room, the most physically attractive people tend to seek out each other and to congregate with only each other.","ups":56923,"post_hint":"link","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":null,"show_media":true,"description":"[](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/#newlink)\n[New to reddit?

No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.
