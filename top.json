Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

Don’t violate Reddit's Content Policy**\n1. Pretty simple. Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, incite violence, etc. Find the content policy [here] (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). If you disagree with this, take it up with the admins, because we have no say in them.\n\n\n###**II. Don't be a cunt**\n\n1. Also simple. If you come to this sub to be a cunt and to argue about politics, religion, etc in an uncivil way, then you will be banned. This is a shitposting sub dammit, not r/politics.\n\n\n###**III. Shitposts 😃 God awful posts 😡**\n\n1. This subreddit is for shitposts, not gawdawfulposts. and yes, repost chains/blatant karmawhoring posts are godawfulposts, not shitposts. Posting literal shit=ban. [Due to the poll addressing user complaints](https://redd.it/piumy6) the following are now being removed: unoriginal comment baiting posts (AMA, start arguing, ask questions and edit) and CUM spam. \n\n\n###**IV. Mod discretion**\n\n1. Mods have final say on what content stays or goes. Pursuant to Comb. Civ. C. §22SA{g}{i} We reserve the right to ban users for making our subreddit terrible\n\n\n###**V. Kevin**\n\n1. Kevin\n\n\n###**VI. No excessive spamming**\n\n1. Pretty easy. Don't spam posts or comments. We are a shitposting sub, but we have *some*, miniscule, standards.\n\n\n###**VII. Number 7**\n\n1. A Bangledeshi 20 year old student was arrested after watching porn, stripping naked and attacking an attendant during a flight. In March 2018, shortly after the Malindo Air flight departed from Kuala Lumpur, the 20 year old started watching pornography on his laptop. As no one seemed to notice or call him out for it, the man began taking his clothes off. At the request of the cabin crew, the student put his clothes back on. But soon, he tried to hug female flight attendants.\n\n\n###**VIII. Really, seriously, don’t be a cunt**\n\n1. That whole “don’t be a cunt” thing, just don’t\n\n\n###**IX. Properly mark NSFW and spoilers**\n\n1. im at work 😡what if my boss sees boobies on my screen 🤬. \"idk if it's nsfw/a spoiler or not\" then just mark it anyways.\n\n\n###**X. Videos must not exceed 1-ish minutes**\n\n1.

It's annoying. Find something else to post or don't post it at all. Reposting anything from the [album of common reposts](https://imgur.com/a/RZDb87E) may result in a seven day ban.*\n**2 - Copypastas are banned** | *Copypastas are BANNED! Any post where the \"cursed content\" is copypasta will be removed.*\n**3 - No unmarked NSFW** | *Any unmarked NSFW posts will result in a 3 day ban.*\n**4 - Asshole** | *Refrain from being an asshole. It's quite simple and we have a low threshold for asshole post removals. Examples include being discriminating or outright abusive. This includes subtle attempts at racism, homophobia, transphobia, and misogyny.*\n**5 - Don't post content from shock accounts** | *Refrain from posting comments from \"shock accounts\" i.e accounts that specifically post \"cursed content\"(/u/SatansLilCumrag666, /u/MagicFart69, etc.)*\n**6 - Don't submit your own content** | *You cannot create and upload your own content. If the OP in the \"cursed content\" is the same OP that is posting it, it will be removed.*\n**7 - Submissions must feature a comment** | *The primary element of your post must be a comment or a piece of cursed content which is otherwise textual communication between two or more people, such as a text message. Submitting a comment that isn't this may result in a 7 day ban.*\n**8 - Keep it cursed** | *A cursed comment is any comment that strikes the reader into oblivion. Upon seeing a cursed comment, your first reaction should be among the lines of “What the F*$k did I just read??” while leaving you speechless at the same time. Incomprehension of the comment just read, or the blatant gruesomeness of it should be enough to not only make you feel mystified but also to draw a smile on your face. Low effort submissions may also be removed* \n**9 - Deepfrying is prohibited** | *Deepfried memes are not tolerated. If your post is garbage enough where you need to deepfry it for humor, don't post it.*\n**10 - Moderator Discretion** | *Moderators may use discretion to upkeep the quality of the subreddit. Obviously fake or otherwise unsuitable content may be removed.*\n**11 - Submission titles must begin with Cursed_** | *eg. Cursed_Potato.*\n**12 - Sexualization or harm of minors** | *Submissions and comments must not be of pedophiliac character or involve the sexualization or extreme physical harm of minors. Failure to do so may result in the ban of the user for the duration of 10 days.*\n\n[Cursed Comments Content Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursedcomments/wiki/content)\n\nENDORSED SUBREDDITS:\n\n/r/blessedcomments\n\n/r/blursedcomments\n\nThese guys are great, check them out!","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"cursedcomments","header_img":null,"title":"Cursed Comments","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#ff0200","icon_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/FuvDrTqKT06Q-N3Zg6kF7-BKdxfQiFeHgd5m4wNR9e8.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":3313829,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"right","display_name_prefixed":"r/cursedcomments","key_color":"#222222","name":"t5_hw1ju","created":1523349095,"url":"/r/cursedcomments/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1523349095,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"The subreddit for comments that strike the reader into oblivion.
