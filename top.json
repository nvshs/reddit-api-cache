No content involving people harming or harassing animals. Please do not submit sunrises, sunsets, or other content which does not have an element of 'wow-factor'. No posting of photoshopped or otherwise excessively and unnecessarily manipulated images.\n\n#####`2.` **Submission Titles**\n\n&gt; Every post title must begin with the fire emoji (🔥) and a space. The fire emoji defines this community. Your post will be automatically removed if you do not follow this rule.\n\n&gt;Titles should be accurate and descriptive: low effort titles will be removed.

Titles cannot say \"[Subject] is Lit\".\n\n#####`3.`  **Reposts**\n\n&gt;No posts that have been previously posted on this subreddit within 120 days (4 months) may be posted again. No posts that have previously been posted on this subreddit with over 10,000 upvotes in the past year may be posted again.\n\n&gt;Search the subreddit for key terms like the animal name before posting to check if your post is a repost. You can also use KarmaDecay and Google Reverse Image Search. Spamming many posts or excessive cross-posting in an attempt to karma farm will get you banned. \n\n#####`5.` **NSFW/L**  \n\n&gt;We do not allow NSFW content: bloody, gory and violent content can be redirected to our sister subreddit /r/natureismetal.\n\n\n#####`6.` **Human Concerns**  \n\n&gt; No politics, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, diet, or similar topics of human conceit.

These numbers are not high and don’t take long to achieve, but the exact numbers are hidden so karma farming bots can’t just meet them easily then come here. Please do not send us a message to inquire about our karma rules. It's a question we do not and will not answer, nor do we override.

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you…\" or \"When they…\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed. Try /r/NSFWfunny. Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed.

Hover below for more info, and check out our [wiki page](/r/mildlyinteresting/wiki)!**\n\n-----\n&gt; ### 1. No memes \n&gt; This includes references in titles of your post (e.g. \"banana for scale,\" \"potato quality\").\n\n----- \n\n&gt; ### 2. No related posts\n&gt; Posts that acknowledge, \"one-up,\" or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. \"I see your X and raise you Y\")\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###3. No x-posts or reposts\n&gt; Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.\n\n&gt; **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post. Posts deleted or removed from other subreddits are not exempt from rule 3. \n\n----- \n\n&gt; ###4. Original [OC] photographs only\n&gt; **a.** No gifs, videos, or websites.  \n\n&gt; **b.** All submissions must be original content. If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.  \n\n&gt; **c.** Software glitches/errors, overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed, although you may censor personal information per Reddit-wide rules.\n\n&gt; **d.** Side by side images are okay if they adhere to the rest of the rules.\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###5. No screenshots\n\n&gt; No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab. This means no images of screens, pictures of screens taken with a different device, images that have been partially or fully generated by a computer, or pictures of printed out screenshots. Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n&gt; **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n&gt; **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n&gt; **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image.

This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).\n####What does \"Oddly Satisfying\" mean?\nWe are forever searching for a \"true definition\". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* \"oddly satisfying\" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.\n\n***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**\n\n######Rules:\n**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**\n###1)  **Banned Topics:**\nWe have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:\n\n* **Memes or image macros**\n\n* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as \"2048\", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.\n\n* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.\n\n* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).\n\n* **Compilation Albums/Videos**\n  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**\n  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).\n  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.\n\n* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.\n\n* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. \n\n###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** \nNSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (\"Say it, don't show it.\"). \n\n###3)  **Reposts:** \n**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.\n\n* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.\n\n* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as \"My...\", \"Mine...\", \"Our...\", \"We...\", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.\n\n###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** \nPlease cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.\n\n* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**\n* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)\n\n###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**\n\n* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: \n  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing &amp; ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.\n\n###8) **Reddiquette, Comments &amp; Subreddit Behavior:**\n\n* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.\n* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.\n* The definition of what truly is \"Oddly Satisfying\" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.\n\n###9) **Crossposts**\n* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma. \n\n#####Related subreddits:\n* /r/ArtisanVideos \n\n* /r/asmr \n\n* /r/clonedgif \n\n* /r/interestingasfuck \n\n* /r/knolling \n\n* /r/loadingicon \n\n* /r/lookscool \n\n* /r/mesmerizinggifs \n\n* /r/mildlyinfuriating \n\n* /r/mildlyinteresting \n\n* r/OrganizationPorn \n\n* /r/parasnailing \n\n* /r/perfectfit \n\n* /r/perfectLoops \n\n* /r/pic \n\n* /r/powerwashingporn \n\n* /r/satisfyinggrass\n\n* /r/showerthoughts \n\n* /r/simulated \n\n* /r/slightlyunsatisfying \n\n* /r/SlyGifs   \n\n* /r/ThatPeelingFeeling\n\n* /r/ThisBlewMyMind \n\n* /r/WtWFotMJaJtRAtCaB [SFW]","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"oddlysatisfying","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6NYespd3jy62IgAehgvHjNFg8z9zBIlFefIn2ZrF5oQ.png","title":"Oddly Satisfying","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#00a6a5","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/65GJujMgAXbydbxxFPYm6eck1YffqR-anhX4-hxnVhQ.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[115,120],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9376226,"submit_text_label":"Texty-text text","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/oddlysatisfying","key_color":"#ff66ac","name":"t5_2x93b","created":1368595528,"url":"/r/oddlysatisfying/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1368595528,"banner_size":[1280,384],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"For those little things that are inexplicably satisfying.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"cats","title":"He was making biscuits on my face 😫","ups":40816,"post_hint":"hosted:video","media":{"reddit_video":{"bitrate_kbps":4800,"fallback_url":"https://v.redd.it/1oimphnyj4wa1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback","height":1080,"width":608,"scrubber_media_url":"https://v.redd.it/1oimphnyj4wa1/DASH_96.mp4","dash_url":"https://v.redd.it/1oimphnyj4wa1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1685115037%2CYzZlYzkxOGMxOWY3NjUzY2Y1OTU4MzU2OWZkMTQxOGFmNzdlZWJmYjFlNDUwNGIyYjg0YmE3NjQxZWJmZjVmNg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","duration":19,"hls_url":"https://v.redd.it/1oimphnyj4wa1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1685115037%2CNzA0OGM3M2JjNDU1MmQ4Nzc3NTVmNWQzMTY0N2QxYWUwY2U2NmM5YTk0MDg4YTU5YzAwMzUxYjBlYjNhYzA1Yg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","is_gif":false,"transcoding_status":"completed"}},"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":["giphy","static","animated"],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2qhta/styles/communityIcon_2fsd7ji8awg91.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0b5ca667995815b9aa608db0dc326bbb8c282a72","show_media":true,"description":"Everything about cats.\n*****\n**Join our Discord server!**\n##[discord.gg/rcats](https://discord.gg/aJaFH4Cw6Q)\n**Filters For Specific Content**\n#####[Everything](http://reddit.com/r/cats)\n#[All Minus Mourning Posts](http://cf.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A%27default%27+OR+flair%3A%27injury%27+OR+flair%3A%27adoption%27+OR+flair%3A%27advice%27+OR+flair%3A%27discussion%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n##[Cat Pictures Only](http://cf.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A%27default%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n###[Discussions](http://cf.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A%27discussion%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n####[Advice and Help Requests](http://cf.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A%27advice%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n*****\n\n**Rules &amp; Guidelines**\n\n**1.** Cats! Post pictures of your cats, talk about cats, ask questions, get advice.\n\n**2.** We prefer that if you post photos, it be of your own cat(s) or one(s) you personally know. If clearly stated, photos of cat(s) you don't know is allowed, within reason. **Lying and claiming/posting someone else's cat is/as your own will result in an immediate ban, with no warnings given.**\n\n**3.** No NSFW content and no animal abuse/cruelty.\n\n**4.** No titles asking for upvotes (e.g. \"This cat didn't get any love in /r/aww\", \"it's my cake day\", \"my first post here\", \"any love for ...\").\n\n**5.** Links asking for funding, competition votes or advertisement will be removed (see the list of subreddits below for a possible alternative).\n\n**6.** Be civil. We have a strong, bright-line policy against insults, namecalling or harassment, and will ban you without notice for such conduct. **If a photo has a person in it along with a cat, don't even think of being creepy or rude to that person. This includes any comments on people's appearance, either positive or negative!**\n\n**7.** Do not post personal information (this includes Facebook links as it can be easily traced back).\n\n**8.** No meme, image macro, low-effort content. Original content is preferred. No image macros, memes, or similar low-effort content. You might want to check out r/MEOW_IRL and r/Catmemes for that.\n\n**9.** Recent/Egregious reposts : Repost of recent or currently popular post from another subreddit for the purpose of farming karma (Rule 10).\n\n**10.** Reposts are allowed (and crossposts are too, don't confuse them!), within reason.\n\n**11.** No posts asking what gender your cat is, ask a vet!\n\n**12.** 'Name my cat/kitten' posts are allowed, but require the correct flair + verification to ensure OC. You must set the flair of your post to 'Name Request' at the time of submission, failing to do so is in breach of this rule. Please submit your post before sending us a modmail - your submission will trigger an automated message which will contain the instructions required for your post to be approved.Your verification message will be left unanswered if you send us a modmail before you have submitted your post for us to review.\n\n\n**13.** Mourning (RIP) posts are allowed. If you do not wish to see them, there are several filters in the sidebar to prevent them from appearing to you.\n\n\n**14.** Merchandise posts are an instant, unreversable bannable offense. No, we don't care if you've contributed to the subreddit before or not. Post any merchandise, you will be banned forever and we will not reverse it. We're here for your feline friends, not your merchandise. \n\n\n**The moderators of this subreddit are not responsible for any medical advice given and we suggest that you don't follow or post it. Go see a vet! Please do not give medical advice to posters if you are not a medical professional with experience treating cats.**\n\nSome of these rules are based upon [Reddit's site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules), [Reddit's TOS](http://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement) and [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).\n\n\n\n[](http://se.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A004&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=hot&amp;t=all/#adv \"Advice Needed\")[](http://se.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A005&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=hot&amp;t=all/#misc \"Misc\")[](http://se.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A003&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=hot&amp;t=all/#all \"All Flair\") [](http://se.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A002&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=hot&amp;t=all/#pic \"Pictures\")[](http://se.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A001&amp;sort=hot&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all/#rip \"RIP\")[](http://www.reddit.com/r/cats/#main \"Full Sub\") [](http://se.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A006&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=hot&amp;t=all/#oc \"Original Content\")\n\nFor donations and adoptions visit /r/care, /r/assistance, /r/rescuecats or your local subreddits, i.e. r/*city or state*.\n\nr/HelpingLostPets\n\nCat Subreddit Lists\n\n[**Animal Subreddit Wiki**](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalReddits/wiki/faq#wiki_cats_-_domestic) | [**Cat Related Subreddits**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catsubs/wiki/index)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Participating in covid disinformation subreddits is grounds to be denied access to this community. \nIn our experience people who frequent these types of subreddits do not participate in good faith and are not a good fit for the type of atmosphere we wish to foster on this subreddit.**","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"cats","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/IcZmzh36fKIDw9c6sI-0WvjW9e-64rmzz6u6_HoT94o.png","title":"Cats","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#fe3f00","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tAT1hlAs4s7wGyszOHRrTVGNOnyZZWazTv6QEtlUHiQ.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[180,60],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":4199512,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"right","display_name_prefixed":"r/cats","key_color":"#ff4500","name":"t5_2qhta","created":1208203028,"url":"/r/cats/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1208203028,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Pictures, videos, questions, and articles featuring/about cats.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"Wellthatsucks","title":"If you take the low road, you're not a victim when they meet you there [not oc]","ups":40125,"post_hint":"hosted:video","media":{"reddit_video":{"bitrate_kbps":2400,"fallback_url":"https://v.redd.it/xylbel7752wa1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback","height":720,"width":406,"scrubber_media_url":"https://v.redd.it/xylbel7752wa1/DASH_96.mp4","dash_url":"https://v.redd.it/xylbel7752wa1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1685115037%2CNjM2MGMxNWE3YmE0YWU2N2VjZjYwNjQ5MGM3OTNiMDVjN2E1ZjRlOTE2NTU3Zjg4MTUyNmVjOGZmYjc5ZGFkYg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","duration":24,"hls_url":"https://v.redd.it/xylbel7752wa1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1685115037%2COGNkZjYwY2U4M2E0YWEyNDhmYTJlZTI1NjJhYmQ0ZTQyYzE4MjVhMjk1MWU1ODk3YzkxYWZmMDZkZjAwNTdkMQ%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","is_gif":false,"transcoding_status":"completed"}},"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":false,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2xcv7/styles/communityIcon_qh0l6ajgijq41.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1d5d6b8eb67af9ecbdceb36a1f5a24f4515716b6","show_media":true,"description":"For everything that happens in everyday life that makes you say \"well, that sucks\" \n\n**Rules:**\n\n\n1. **Please follow [reddiquette]( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).**  We will not allow behavior contrary to reddiquette\n\n\n2. **Please be civil.** Rude comments or harassing comments will be removed and may result in a ban.\n\n\n3. **Serious Injuries.** No serious injuries.
