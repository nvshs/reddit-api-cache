Do not post things that are racist/sexist/homophobic. Depending on the content, you may receive a ban, and your comment/submission will be removed. Again, you're not going to run up against this rule unless you attempt to do so. \n\n* **IF** a submission is a comeback due to someone being racist, that *may* be accepted. Otherwise, there is zero tolerance. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule5)\n\n\n###6. No Doxxing/brigading\n* Links to other subreddits, even np links are not allowed. Screenshots only. Screenshots from any source must obscure identifying information. The only exception is for people who are already public figures. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule6)\n\n\n###7. Moderator discretion is FINAL\n* Many rules on the sub are enforced by moderators on post-by-post, comment-by-comment level.

And any other vote related bullshit for that matter.\n\n* Posts *MUST* be in some way \"too real\" or hit to close to home. If it doesn't make you laugh and feel sad at the same time, don't post it here. Posts that do not fit the sub may be removed.\n\n* Being edgy doesn't make a post good. Post content that you find a bit too relatable, not something making fun of people with depression.\n\n* Posts should be titled 2meirl4meirl or some variation, but other titles are fine for ~~shitposts~~ self posts.\n\n* Be supportive. Most people here are going through something, and sometimes all it takes to improve a shitty day is just a little kindness from an Internet stranger.\n\n* Racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, any other form of discrimination and general dickishness *will not be tolerated.*\n\n* Mark NSFW content as such. And please don't post NSFL content, we are not /r/watchpeopledie\n\n* **Reposts are allowed**, but discouraged\n\n* Don't link to an image if it won't be there permanently. Basically, just don't link to files hosted on 4chan.\n\n* Again, please don't be an asshole.\n\n* If any of you fucbois post mr skeltal you will not have good bones and calcium, and instead your post will be removed.

No content involving people harming or harassing animals. Please do not submit sunrises, sunsets, or other content which does not have an element of 'wow-factor'.

You can also use KarmaDecay and Google Reverse Image Search. Spamming many posts or excessive cross-posting in an attempt to karma farm will get you banned. \n\n#####`5.` **NSFW/L**  \n\n&gt;We do not allow NSFW content: bloody, gory and violent content can be redirected to our sister subreddit /r/natureismetal.\n\n\n#####`6.` **Human Concerns**  \n\n&gt; No politics, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, diet, or similar topics of human conceit.

These numbers are not high and don‚Äôt take long to achieve, but the exact numbers are hidden so karma farming bots can‚Äôt just meet them easily then come here.
