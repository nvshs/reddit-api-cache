Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

This is a happy place. Be respectful.\n\nComments or posts not in keeping with the tone of the sub will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nBullying, racism, homophobia and sexual comments in any form, comments or links, will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nIf the comment section gets too heated, it will get locked.\n\n###2. Audible and contagious laughing\n\nAll videos must contain contagious laughter.\n\nDo not post videos that are just funny because of a joke or a situation.\n\nAudience or edited in laughter does not count as contagious laughter.\n\nCompilations are mostly old and common reposts. Please refrain from posting them here.\n\nNo bullying or victimisation. No videos of people fighting or otherwise bad natured laughs.\n\n###3. Video length\n\nVideos must be at least 10 seconds long and have a good amount of laughing in them.\n\nIf the video is more than 1 minute long, please link directly to the specific moment when it is appropriate to start watching. Alternatively include the appropriate time code in the post title.\n\n###4. No reposts\n\nReposts may be removed to encourage fresh content.\n\nRemember to check top posts and search using keywords before you post.\n\nIt's also wise to check newest posts to see if someone has just posted the same viral video you are crossposting.\n\n###5. Post must have a proper title\n\nUse a descriptive title. Bad titles are hard to search and leads to more unnecessary reposts. Mods have the final word on what is considered a bad title.\n\nExamples of bad titles: \".\", \"title\", \"😂😂\", \"funny title\", \"wait for it\", \"this made me laugh\"\n\n###6. No content promotion\n\nThis subreddit is not your personal marketing place. No spamming in general.\n\n###7. No politics\n\nPolitical videos and arguments are not allowed and will be removed.

Artists are encouraged to post their own work.  News and media for adaptations based on comic books are welcome. Read [the subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/wiki/index) for more information about the subreddit.\n\n\n##[General Conduct](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_general_conduct)\n\n&gt; 1. **[Don't complain about comics you don't like or understand.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_1._don.27t_complain_about_comics_you_don.27t_like.)** - If you don't get a comic, it's probably not meant for you. Comics are often targeted at certain audiences. If you don't get a comic, odds are it wasn't meant for you. Don't whine about it; just move on to the next comic.\n2. **[Don't attack artists posting their content.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_2._don.27t_attack_artists_posting_their_content)** - It's not ok to attack artists with hateful comments meant to tear them down or try to chase them off Reddit. \n3. **[Don't make drama for drama's sake. No trolling.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_3._don.27t_make_drama_for_drama.27s_sake._no_trolling.)** - Anyone wanting to participate in this community needs to keep their comments civil.  No hateful comments or posts - Any comments or posts that are racist, mysogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, misinformation or extremist in nature will be removed and will result in an immediate ban.\n4. **[Respect the [OC] System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_4._respect_the_.5Boc.5D_system)** - The [OC] tag is for artists wanting to submit their Original Content.  False claims on others' art will get you banned.\n5. **[Respect the Report System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_5._respect_the_report_system)** - Reports are for content that breaks this sub's/Reddit's rules.  False reports are given to the Reddit Admins. \n6. **[Tag NSFW content when needed.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_6._tag_nsfw_content_when_needed.)** - Content with nudity, pornography, or obvious profanity should be tagged as NSFW.  \n\n##[What is OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_ok_to_post)\n\n&gt; * **Comic covers or short excerpts** - *A few* scanned pages can be posted for discussion.  Don't post entire comic books.  Posts with too many pages will get removed.\n* **Web comic strips** - Most strips need to be linked back to original sources (i.e. the artists' websites).   Don't link to [rehosted](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_rehosting) or [hotlinked](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_hotlinking) comics.

Post pictures of your cats, talk about cats, ask questions, get advice.\n\n**2.** We prefer that if you post photos, it be of your own cat(s) or one(s) you personally know. If clearly stated, photos of cat(s) you don't know is allowed, within reason. **Lying and claiming/posting someone else's cat is/as your own will result in an immediate ban, with no warnings given.**\n\n**3.** No NSFW content and no animal abuse/cruelty.\n\n**4.** No titles asking for upvotes (e.g. \"This cat didn't get any love in /r/aww\", \"it's my cake day\", \"my first post here\", \"any love for ...\").\n\n**5.** Links asking for funding, competition votes or advertisement will be removed (see the list of subreddits below for a possible alternative).\n\n**6.** Be civil. We have a strong, bright-line policy against insults, namecalling or harassment, and will ban you without notice for such conduct. **If a photo has a person in it along with a cat, don't even think of being creepy or rude to that person. This includes any comments on people's appearance, either positive or negative!**\n\n**7.** Do not post personal information (this includes Facebook links as it can be easily traced back).\n\n**8.** No meme, image macro, low-effort content. Original content is preferred. No image macros, memes, or similar low-effort content. You might want to check out r/MEOW_IRL and r/Catmemes for that.\n\n**9.** Recent/Egregious reposts : Repost of recent or currently popular post from another subreddit for the purpose of farming karma (Rule 10).\n\n**10.** Reposts are allowed (and crossposts are too, don't confuse them!), within reason.\n\n**11.** No posts asking what gender your cat is, ask a vet!\n\n**12.** 'Name my cat/kitten' posts are allowed, but require the correct flair + verification to ensure OC. You must set the flair of your post to 'Name Request' at the time of submission, failing to do so is in breach of this rule. Please submit your post before sending us a modmail - your submission will trigger an automated message which will contain the instructions required for your post to be approved.Your verification message will be left unanswered if you send us a modmail before you have submitted your post for us to review.\n\n\n**13.** Mourning (RIP) posts are allowed. If you do not wish to see them, there are several filters in the sidebar to prevent them from appearing to you.\n\n\n**14.** Merchandise posts are an instant, unreversable bannable offense. No, we don't care if you've contributed to the subreddit before or not. Post any merchandise, you will be banned forever and we will not reverse it. We're here for your feline friends, not your merchandise. \n\n\n**The moderators of this subreddit are not responsible for any medical advice given and we suggest that you don't follow or post it. Go see a vet! Please do not give medical advice to posters if you are not a medical professional with experience treating cats.**\n\nSome of these rules are based upon [Reddit's site-wide rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules), [Reddit's TOS](http://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement) and [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).\n\n\n\n[](http://se.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A004&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=hot&amp;t=all/#adv \"Advice Needed\")[](http://se.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A005&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=hot&amp;t=all/#misc \"Misc\")[](http://se.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A003&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=hot&amp;t=all/#all \"All Flair\") [](http://se.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A002&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=hot&amp;t=all/#pic \"Pictures\")[](http://se.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A001&amp;sort=hot&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all/#rip \"RIP\")[](http://www.reddit.com/r/cats/#main \"Full Sub\") [](http://se.reddit.com/r/cats/search?q=flair%3A006&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=hot&amp;t=all/#oc \"Original Content\")\n\nFor donations and adoptions visit /r/care, /r/assistance, /r/rescuecats or your local subreddits, i.e. r/*city or state*.\n\nr/HelpingLostPets\n\nCat Subreddit Lists\n\n[**Animal Subreddit Wiki**](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalReddits/wiki/faq#wiki_cats_-_domestic) | [**Cat Related Subreddits**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Catsubs/wiki/index)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Participating in covid disinformation subreddits is grounds to be denied access to this community. \nIn our experience people who frequent these types of subreddits do not participate in good faith and are not a good fit for the type of atmosphere we wish to foster on this subreddit.**","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"cats","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/IcZmzh36fKIDw9c6sI-0WvjW9e-64rmzz6u6_HoT94o.png","title":"Cats","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#fe3f00","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tAT1hlAs4s7wGyszOHRrTVGNOnyZZWazTv6QEtlUHiQ.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[180,60],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":4186378,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"right","display_name_prefixed":"r/cats","key_color":"#ff4500","name":"t5_2qhta","created":1208203028,"url":"/r/cats/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1208203028,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Pictures, videos, questions, and articles featuring/about cats.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"HumansBeingBros","title":"This Hero offers judgment-free veterinary care for the pets of those experiencing homelessness","ups":46703,"post_hint":"hosted:video","media":{"reddit_video":{"bitrate_kbps":2400,"fallback_url":"https://v.redd.it/giidj4azv1va1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback","height":720,"width":406,"scrubber_media_url":"https://v.redd.it/giidj4azv1va1/DASH_96.mp4","dash_url":"https://v.redd.it/giidj4azv1va1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1684623641%2CMjdjMDlkNGIyZWExMDZjOWRkOWFlMTRlZTE0NjFlOTJiMmY2NTg3NTJjYWM1ZmIxMzQ2YmY3MzEwZTgwMGVkOA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","duration":86,"hls_url":"https://v.redd.it/giidj4azv1va1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1684623641%2CZGE0N2NlZDMyOWI3YTg1YWEyNTA0NjU3YTk3N2U4NDU4N2VjYzg4ZjhlMjk0NTNhOGRhNWNmN2NhZjU0OGRmNw%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","is_gif":false,"transcoding_status":"completed"}},"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":null,"show_media":true,"description":"&gt; A place for sharing videos, gifs, and images of humans being bros.\n\n- If you see any posts that violate any of the rules, please report the post and message the mods a link to it\n\n###[Our discord for all bros](https://discord.gg/wp4jnrhc25)\n\n# Rules\n\n\n\n1. **No hate speech &amp; no slap fights.** Open debate is welcome, but be civil and do not resort to personal attacks or insults regardless of how much you may disagree with the other person.  Do not resort to name calling, or use condescending or patronizing language.  Racism, sexism or bigotry will not be tolerated.  Making inappropriate jokes with sexist or racist undertones is strictly prohibited. Violation of this rule may result in a ban\n\n2. **Posts must depict humans actually being bros.** Please do not post humans engaging in normal human behavior which might simply appeal to humans.\n\n3. **No reliance on additional context.**  The 'bro' action should be easily discernible within the image/gif/video. Having to add context in the title, comments, super-imposed text or otherwise to explain the 'bro' is against sub rules.  Submissions violating this rule will be removed\n\n4. **No reposts.** All reposts are removed at moderators discretion.  Repost farming is not allowed and will result in a ban.  Check the sub prior to posting to see if your submission has already been posted\n\n5.  **NSFW content.** NSFW content is sometimes okay here, but it must be flagged appropriately.  We do not allow any content related to suicide, or suicide prevention.  No rage bait submissions.  Any content that is sexually suggestive or contains drug use is grounds for a permanent ban\n\n6. **No Spam.** Original content and crossposts from other subreddits are welcome, but we do not allow posts promoting a specific website, YouTube channel, blog, subreddit etc. Such posts will be removed, reported as spam, and you will be banned. Creating a post for the sole purpose to redirect to another subreddit will be removed as spam\n\n7. **No staged submissions.** Scenes set up to look helpful are staged and will be removed.  Staged videos made by content creators for clout on TikTok, YouTube or Instagram will also be removed at moderators discretion.  No poverty porn or exploitative media.  We do not allow skits or social experiment videos.\n\n8. **No memes, comics, or compilations.** Refrain from posting jokes, memes, puns, reaction gifs and wordplays. No compilation videos, gifs, pictures, etc.\n\n9. **No Fundraising/Request/Donation Posts.** This includes any post or comment asking for people to perform a 'bro' action. Examples include: attending funerals, mailing cards, petitions, joining livestreams, and GoFundMe campaigns. Moderators will ban those violating this rule.\n\n10. **No spreading misinformation.** Sharing a source and debating that source or topic in a fair and reasonable manner (i.e., without personal attacks) is encouraged. Do not make wildly unsubstantiated and/or outlandish claims without the ability to share a source.\n\n11. **No posts or comments directly about politics and no bringing politics into a post or comment not about politics.  No war related content.  No posts centered around police**\n\n12.  **No text only submissions.** This includes screenshots of text messages, twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Reddit screenshots from other communities will be reviewed on a case by case basis.  Images of text are prohibited.  This includes:  cards, letters, notes. \n\n13. **No slurs, harassing or trolling comments.  No racial slurs or sexually inappropriate comments. No hate speech.** This includes comments implying the animal in the image/gif is food, or will be eaten. Jokes about animals being food are not welcome.\nDo not post comments with a personal agenda or in an attempt to derail the thread or harass or troll other users.\n **Users violating this rule will be faced with a temporary or permanent ban**\n\n\n14.  **Comments that do not contribute to the discussion will be removed, and may face a temporary or permanent ban. Examples:**\n\n* this is fake \n* bet this was staged for likes/upvotes/clout \n* why did they have to film this?\n\n**Pot-stirring, trolling or bad-faith commentary about our content or its authenticity will not be allowed.** Discussion about the provenance and authenticity of submissions will be removed.\n\n\n**Evidence must be provided if you suspect a specific post is staged**\n \n\n# Moderators reserve the right to remove content they deem harmful to the sub.\n\n\n###### [The Being Network](https://www.reddit.com/user/pencer/m/thebeingnetwork)\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingJerks\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingBros\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingDerps\n\n&gt;r/KeanuBeingAwesome\n\n&gt;r/PeopleBeingJerks\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingConfused\n\n&gt;r/HumansBeingJerks\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingPolite\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingSleepy\n\n&gt;r/PlantsBeingJerks\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingFunny\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingAnimals\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingMoms\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingSmart\n\n### Related Subs\n\n&gt; [The Being Network](http://www.reddit.com/user/pencer/m/thebeingnetwork) For all things being\n\n&gt;r/MadeMeSmile\n\n\n&gt;r/TodayIamHappy\n\n[](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"HumansBeingBros","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tXu_YNSw_DtYABgQLomfBeKyl1cGhe97pQYAYaE5Cig.png","title":"Humans just being bros","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/8rNZZcmVTZLAc_FEktfnShC5kmyT-Ie-1Fn_JenZL2U.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[50,50],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":4921735,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"right","display_name_prefixed":"r/HumansBeingBros","key_color":"#7e53c1","name":"t5_2xh58","created":1370546795,"url":"/r/HumansBeingBros/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1370546795,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"A place for sharing videos, gifs, and images of people being total bros.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}}]
