Don‚Äôt violate Reddit's Content Policy**\n1. Pretty simple. Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, incite violence, etc. Find the content policy [here] (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). If you disagree with this, take it up with the admins, because we have no say in them.\n\n\n###**II. Don't be a cunt**\n\n1. Also simple. If you come to this sub to be a cunt and to argue about politics, religion, etc in an uncivil way, then you will be banned. This is a shitposting sub dammit, not r/politics.\n\n\n###**III. Shitposts üòÉ God awful posts üò°**\n\n1. This subreddit is for shitposts, not gawdawfulposts. and yes, repost chains/blatant karmawhoring posts are godawfulposts, not shitposts. Posting literal shit=ban. [Due to the poll addressing user complaints](https://redd.it/piumy6) the following are now being removed: unoriginal comment baiting posts (AMA, start arguing, ask questions and edit) and CUM spam. \n\n\n###**IV. Mod discretion**\n\n1. Mods have final say on what content stays or goes. Pursuant to Comb. Civ. C. ¬ß22SA{g}{i} We reserve the right to ban users for making our subreddit terrible\n\n\n###**V. Kevin**\n\n1. Kevin\n\n\n###**VI. No excessive spamming**\n\n1. Pretty easy. Don't spam posts or comments. We are a shitposting sub, but we have *some*, miniscule, standards.\n\n\n###**VII. Number 7**\n\n1. A Bangledeshi 20 year old student was arrested after watching porn, stripping naked and attacking an attendant during a flight. In March 2018, shortly after the Malindo Air flight departed from Kuala Lumpur, the 20 year old started watching pornography on his laptop. As no one seemed to notice or call him out for it, the man began taking his clothes off. At the request of the cabin crew, the student put his clothes back on. But soon, he tried to hug female flight attendants.\n\n\n###**VIII. Really, seriously, don‚Äôt be a cunt**\n\n1. That whole ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be a cunt‚Äù thing, just don‚Äôt\n\n\n###**IX. Properly mark NSFW and spoilers**\n\n1. im at work üò°what if my boss sees boobies on my screen ü§¨. \"idk if it's nsfw/a spoiler or not\" then just mark it anyways.\n\n\n###**X. Videos must not exceed 1-ish minutes**\n\n1.

Submissions must be something you saw that was odd and out of the ordinary for your work setting. Only original content is acceptable. Do not post pictures taken by others.  Automotive and Non-automotive mechanical failure/oddities ONLY. Examples of this include computers, HVAC, aircraft, helicopters, etc. Animals do not fall under the guidelines of Rule #1.\n\n2. Posts need not be automotive related, but must follow rule 1.\n\n3. This is not a place to ask for help troubleshooting your vehicles issues. You can instead post these to our sister subreddit: /r/MechanicAdvice. Posts of this nature will be removed.\n\n4. If it's not obvious, please include a detailed description of what the problem is or what the thing in the picture does/is supposed to do.\n\n5. No memes or rage comics. \n\n6. Do not link photos from Facebook.  If you have a photo from FB you want to post, upload it into [Imgur](http://imgur.com/) then post from there.  Linking from FB causes security issues for the persons profile.\n\n7. Please mark pictures with blood/gore/sexually natured as NSFW.\n\n8. Please cover or remove license plate numbers, VINs, phone numbers, and names.\n\n9. Do not post a \"spotted picture\" /r/Spotted,  /r/JRITSlounge, or /r/SeenOnTheStreet  are the proper places for those posts. Any offending posts will be deleted, this rule will be enforced with extreme prejudice. \n\n10. Discussions and questions that promote discussion are allowed, but questions cannot be of an /r/MechanicAdvice nature.  For example, \"What is the worst customer experience you've had?\" is allowed while \"What's wrong with my car?\" is not.  \n\n11. Absolutely no sale site posts.  This includes Craigslist, Ebay, Facebook sale groups, etc.  For more explanation, see rule 1. \n\n12. Trend posts or \"karma trains\" will be regulated at the discretion of the moderators, as they often lead to rule breaking when they get out of hand. \n\n--&gt; If you do not see your submitted post in \"new\" within 5 minutes, message the mods with the URL to your submission and we can fish it out of the spam filter for you.\n\nVisit our friends!:\n=============\n\n/r/JRITSlounge\n\n/r/JRITSmod\n\n____________\n\n/r/airframeandpowerplant\n\n/r/AskAShittyMechanic\n\n/r/AutoDetailing\n\n/r/AutomotiveLearning \n\n/r/AutomotiveTraining\n\n/r/carporn\n\n/r/cartalk\n\n/r/coolcarsforsale\n\n/r/Diesel\n\n/r/drivermacgyver\n\n/r/ElCamino\n\n/r/EngineBuilding \n\n/r/Hookit\n\n/r/localcarenthusiasts/\n\n/r/machinists\n\n/r/MechanicAdvice\n\n/r/manufacturing\n\n/r/partscounter\n\n/r/projectcar\n\n/r/RandomActsOfMechanics\n\n/r/ratbikes\n\n/r/RatRod\n\n/r/Riced\n\n/r/scrapheap\n\n/r/SeenOnTheStreet\n\n/r/shitty_car_mods\n\n/r/Skookum \n\n/r/Spotted (full vehicles only, no random junkers or car parts)\n\n/r/toolboxmods\n\n/r/toolporn\n\n/r/Welding \n\n/r/WeirdWheels\n\n/r/WorkBoots\n_________\n\n/r/Datsun \n\n/r/Fiat\n\n/r/jaguar\n\n/r/Jeep\n\n/r/Mazda\n\n/r/peugeot\n\n/r/Saab\n\n/r/s10 \n\n/r/Camaro\n\n/r/ChevyCorsica","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"Justrolledintotheshop","header_img":"https://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/5bkRocO5lnaqAYaz.png","title":"Just Rolled Into the Shop","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":null,"primary_color":"#373c3f","icon_img":"","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a new failure picture","header_size":[112,128],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":1966834,"submit_text_label":"Submit a new failure story","link_flair_position":"right","display_name_prefixed":"r/Justrolledintotheshop","key_color":"#0079d3","name":"t5_2tteh","created":1333059756,"url":"/r/Justrolledintotheshop/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1333059756,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"For those absolutely stupid things that you see people bring, roll, or toss into your place of business and the people that bring them in.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"Baking","title":"Poliwag roll cake, took me over 5 tries to get right, but I'm really proud of it","ups":66973,"post_hint":"hosted:video","media":{"reddit_video":{"bitrate_kbps":4800,"fallback_url":"https://v.redd.it/tq360w8kthna1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback","height":1080,"width":608,"scrubber_media_url":"https://v.redd.it/tq360w8kthna1/DASH_96.mp4","dash_url":"https://v.redd.it/tq360w8kthna1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1681367443%2CZTUwMGJiZDczZTVhZjM0ZTYwM2UxOWI3NzViYTIyOTU4YmQ2YmIyYjQ5YTU0MGYzODQ2ZTM1MDQxNjIzOGFlNA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","duration":13,"hls_url":"https://v.redd.it/tq360w8kthna1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1681367443%2CNWY2ZGNiMTE4NGU1ODlmZmQ3YjQ0ZTI0NTRiOThiNjNlMDFjNDZlZWEzZDQyZDUxY2M0NzZiMzdjNTgwNTUwZg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","is_gif":false,"transcoding_status":"completed"}},"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2qx1h/styles/communityIcon_bpprg3isxj851.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6d908b81a2ec71c4030f1de48e1b99adbef4373f","show_media":true,"description":"---\n\nFor all your baking needs!\nRecipes, ideas and all things baking related.\n\nCakes, cookies, pies, tarts, muffins, scones, short- rye- wheat- and naan breads welcome!

This is a happy place. Be respectful.\n\nComments or posts not in keeping with the tone of the sub will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nBullying, racism, homophobia and sexual comments in any form, comments or links, will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nIf the comment section gets too heated, it will get locked.\n\n###2. Audible and contagious laughing\n\nAll videos must contain contagious laughter.\n\nDo not post videos that are just funny because of a joke or a situation.\n\nAudience or edited in laughter does not count as contagious laughter.\n\nCompilations are mostly old and common reposts. Please refrain from posting them here.\n\nNo bullying or victimisation. No videos of people fighting or otherwise bad natured laughs.\n\n###3. Video length\n\nVideos must be at least 10 seconds long and have a good amount of laughing in them.\n\nIf the video is more than 1 minute long, please link directly to the specific moment when it is appropriate to start watching. Alternatively include the appropriate time code in the post title.\n\n###4. No reposts\n\nReposts may be removed to encourage fresh content.\n\nRemember to check top posts and search using keywords before you post.\n\nIt's also wise to check newest posts to see if someone has just posted the same viral video you are crossposting.\n\n###5. Post must have a proper title\n\nUse a descriptive title. Bad titles are hard to search and leads to more unnecessary reposts. Mods have the final word on what is considered a bad title.\n\nExamples of bad titles: \".\", \"title\", \"üòÇüòÇ\", \"funny title\", \"wait for it\", \"this made me laugh\"\n\n###6. No content promotion\n\nThis subreddit is not your personal marketing place. No spamming in general.\n\n###7. No politics\n\nPolitical videos and arguments are not allowed and will be removed.

Artists are encouraged to post their own work.  News and media for adaptations based on comic books are welcome. Read [the subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/wiki/index) for more information about the subreddit.\n\n\n##[General Conduct](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_general_conduct)\n\n&gt; 1. **[Don't complain about comics you don't like or understand.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_1._don.27t_complain_about_comics_you_don.27t_like.)** - If you don't get a comic, it's probably not meant for you. Comics are often targeted at certain audiences. If you don't get a comic, odds are it wasn't meant for you. Don't whine about it; just move on to the next comic.\n2. **[Don't attack artists posting their content.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_2._don.27t_attack_artists_posting_their_content)** - It's not ok to attack artists with hateful comments meant to tear them down or try to chase them off Reddit. \n3. **[Don't make drama for drama's sake. No trolling.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_3._don.27t_make_drama_for_drama.27s_sake._no_trolling.)** - Anyone wanting to participate in this community needs to keep their comments civil.  No hateful comments or posts - Any comments or posts that are racist, mysogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, misinformation or extremist in nature will be removed and will result in an immediate ban.\n4. **[Respect the [OC] System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_4._respect_the_.5Boc.5D_system)** - The [OC] tag is for artists wanting to submit their Original Content.  False claims on others' art will get you banned.\n5. **[Respect the Report System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_5._respect_the_report_system)** - Reports are for content that breaks this sub's/Reddit's rules.  False reports are given to the Reddit Admins. \n6. **[Tag NSFW content when needed.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_6._tag_nsfw_content_when_needed.)** - Content with nudity, pornography, or obvious profanity should be tagged as NSFW.  \n\n##[What is OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_ok_to_post)\n\n&gt; * **Comic covers or short excerpts** - *A few* scanned pages can be posted for discussion.  Don't post entire comic books.  Posts with too many pages will get removed.\n* **Web comic strips** - Most strips need to be linked back to original sources (i.e. the artists' websites).   Don't link to [rehosted](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_rehosting) or [hotlinked](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_hotlinking) comics. Artists can use [OC] to link to their own work anywhere.\n* **Links to articles, videos, art, cosplay or music** - Content directly related to comic books or web comics, including film and TV media.  \n* **Discussion topics** - Talk about past or present comic books or strips.  Topics about comic-based movies or TV shows are also fine.\n* **Translations** - English translations of non-English original comics are ok as long as the translation is honest and a link to the original source is provided in a comment.\n\n##[What is not OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_not_ok_to_post)\n\n&gt; * **Edits to comics that you didn't make** - Don't remove watermarks/attribution or try to \"fix\" someone else's work.

Submissions\n\n* ####Guidelines:\n\n* Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology\n\n* Self posts must contribute positively to /r/technology and foster reasonable discussion. Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable.\n\n* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions in the technological world.\n\n* ####Please do not submit the following:\n\n* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.\n\n* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. \n\n* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).\n\n* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.\n\n* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).\n\n* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.\n\n* vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.\n\n* viii) Social media links/profiles/invites or promotions (eg. Facebook, Instagram, Pintrest etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. \n\n##2. Behaviour\n\n* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, trolling or bigotry in any form are therefore not allowed and will be removed. Repeated abuse can result in a permanent ban.\n\n##3. Titles\n\n* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote, which must:\n\n* adequately describe the content\n\n* adequately describe the content's relation to technology\n\n* be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning. \n\n##4. Flair\n\n* Please flair your submission appropriately. [An extended guide to flairing can be found here, in the wiki](/r/technology/wiki/flair).\n\n##5. Reddit-wide rules.\n\n* [All reddit-wide rules apply here](/rules). Do not [spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F). No Self Promotion.\n\n***\n\n##Miscellanea\n\n* If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) with your reason.\n\n* Want to host an AMA? Please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).\n\n* Our /u/AutoModerator configuration may be viewed [here](https://imgur.com/a/EOi0n). \n\n* Removed posts will either be given a removal reason flair and/or comment response; please message the moderators if this did not occur.\n\n* All legitimate, answerable modmail inquiries or suggestions will be answered to the best of our abilities within a reasonable period of time. \n\n#Related Subreddits\n\n## Technology\n\n* /r/AskTechnology\n* /r/Futurology\n* /r/Gadgets\n* /r/Hardware\n* /r/Tech\n* /r/Technews\n* /r/Realtech\n* /r/PCMasterRace\n* /r/BuildAPC\n* /r/BuildAPCSales\n* /r/InternetIsBeautiful \n* /r/RenewableEnergy\n* /r/SelfDrivingCars\n* /r/TechSupport\n* /r/TalesFromTechSupport\n* /r/TechSupportGore\n* /r/TechnologyPorn\n* /r/ImaginaryTechnology\n* /r/Kickstarter\n* /r/homeautomation\n\n##PROGRAMMING\n\n* /r/Programming\n* /r/Learnprogramming\n* [Language-Specific Communities](/r/programming/wiki/faq#wiki_what_language_reddits_are_there.3F)\n* /r/CScareerquestions\n* /r/CompSci\n* /r/NetSec\n* /r/Engineering\n* /r/Hacking\n\n\n##OS's\n\n* /r/Windows\n* /r/OSX\n* /r/Linux\n* /r/Ubuntu\n* /r/Debian\n* /r/Archlinux\n* /r/Raspberry_pi\n* /r/Chromeos\n* /r/ReactOS\n* /r/RemixOS\n* /r/Android\n* /r/iOS\n* /r/Jailbreak\n* /r/LineageOS\n\n##SOFTWARE\n\n* /r/Software\n* /r/Firefox\n* /r/Chrome\n* /r/Photoshop \n* /r/Kodi \n\n##POPULAR COMPANIES\n\n* /r/Google\n* /r/Microsoft\n* /r/Apple\n* /r/Amazon\n* /r/Startups\n\n##CRYPTOCURRENCIES\n\n* /r/CryptoCurrency\n* /r/Ethereum\n* /r/BTC\n* /r/Bitcoin\n* /r/Steem\n\n##CAMPAIGNS\n\n* /r/KeepOurNetFree \n* /r/pirateparty \n* /r/privacy","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"technology","header_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/VwBugImhQhFTJhC0HjM9IWyEEEF898HHtI2AunD5SW4.png","title":"/r/Technology ","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/J_fCwTYJkoM-way-eaOHv8AOHoF_jNXNqOvPrQ7bINY.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[40,61],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":13923903,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/technology","key_color":"#0dd3bb","name":"t5_2qh16","created":1201231675,"url":"/r/technology/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1201231675,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Subreddit dedicated to the news and discussions about the creation and use of technology and its surrounding issues.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}}]
