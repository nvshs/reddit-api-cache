The show ran from 2005-2013 but is still watched just as much today. Join us as we discuss the show!\n\n\n---\n\n#####Discord Server\n\nr/DunderMifflin now has a Discord Server. [Click here to join](https://discord.gg/dundermifflin) and discuss the show!\n\n---\n#####Rules\n\n####1) Be Civil\n\nDon't ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been, ever, for any reason whatsoever. \n\n####2) No spam/Low-effort posts\n\nKeep posts directly related to TV show \"The Office\". Low effort posts will be removed, [for examples and more info, click here](https://redd.it/95w3xk). Memes/images from social media will also likely be removed as they're 99% reposts.\n\n####3) No piracy\n\nDon't link to or request episodes hosted illegally online. This includes streams, torrents, cloud-hosted files, etc.\n\n####4) No politics\n\nNo posts related to politics. They always result in uncivil discussion and aren't welcome here. This includes posts mentioning/comparing something or someone from the show to a political figure, or anything you saw at a protest/strike/rally.\n\n####5) No cake-day posts/asking for karma\n\nCake day posts are forbidden unless they are high-effort OC. \n\n####6) Image hosting\n\nImages, GIFs, and Webms to be hosted on Reddit, Imgur, gfycat, or giphy only.\n\n####7) Self-Promotion\n\nThe promotion of products or services whose sale benefits you, either directly or indirectly, is forbidden.\n\n####8) No Merchandise\nPosts that are about items of merchandise (\"look at this cool shirt\", \"I found this board game\", \"I made Cards Against The Office\") are prohibited without prior mod approval.\n\n####9) No New Spoilers\nActors from The Office may feature in new media and franchises. Though it may be tempting to discuss their new roles, feeling like this is a safe community to do so: it isn't. This subreddit is for The Office only. If you make a post or comment that spoils new content (within reason, like for a major franchise) in other \"cinematic universes\", the post will be removed, and you may receive a ban.\n\n[Learn your rules](https://i.redd.it/w9drnp65p5b11.gif)\n\n#####Guidelines:\n\n####Reposts\n\nPlease do not repost. Frequent reposts will be removed, please search the sub before posting.\n\nRecent reposts will also be removed. If you're posting a recent tweet/article/headline, it's probably already been submitted.\n\n####Stay relevant\n\nMake sure your whole post is relevant to the show, not just the title or image.
