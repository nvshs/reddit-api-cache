Submissions\n\n* ####Guidelines:\n\n* Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology\n\n* Self posts must contribute positively to /r/technology and foster reasonable discussion. Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable.\n\n* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions in the technological world.\n\n* ####Please do not submit the following:\n\n* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.\n\n* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. \n\n* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).\n\n* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.\n\n* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).\n\n* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.\n\n* vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.\n\n* viii) Social media links/profiles/invites or promotions (eg. Facebook, Instagram, Pintrest etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. \n\n##2. Behaviour\n\n* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, trolling or bigotry in any form are therefore not allowed and will be removed. Repeated abuse can result in a permanent ban.\n\n##3. Titles\n\n* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote, which must:\n\n* adequately describe the content\n\n* adequately describe the content's relation to technology\n\n* be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning. \n\n##4. Flair\n\n* Please flair your submission appropriately. [An extended guide to flairing can be found here, in the wiki](/r/technology/wiki/flair).\n\n##5. Reddit-wide rules.\n\n* [All reddit-wide rules apply here](/rules). Do not [spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F). No Self Promotion.\n\n***\n\n##Miscellanea\n\n* If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) with your reason.\n\n* Want to host an AMA?

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you…\" or \"When they…\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed. Try /r/NSFWfunny. Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social media or electronic messaging content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed. This includes anything from Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, or any form of \"comments section\" on the Internet, as well as [content accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png).

Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned.

Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

No image macros, text conversations, or YouTube links. Just because somebody posted one of these on social media does not exempt it from this rule. Vines and such belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleVines/) and gifs belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackpeoplegifs).\n\n6.) Typical Reddit cliches such as **lyric chains**, **pun chains**, white-knighting, and low-effort joke comments will be removed.

Please search or look through BPT's older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts.\n\n8.) No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you think of something acceptable/reasonable. **Don't put the punchline in the title of the post**. Do not add \"bruh\", \"fam\", or similar vernacular to your post or comment.\n\n9.) Don't complain about [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) or slang. Use [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com) if you do not understand the meaning of a word. Comments asking \"what does x mean?\" will be removed. \n\n\n10.) BPT is an inclusive space for POC and allies alike.  This sub highlights minority viewpoints, through humor, commentary, or criticism.  Please respect these voices and show you care about black opinions as much as you care about black humor.\n \n11.) Don't post things from meme/corporate accounts.

Use the report function to flag abusive comments rather than responding and escalating. \n\n4. **Trolls and brigaders** will be banned summarily.\n\n5. **Racism and hate speech** will not be allowed.

Don’t violate Reddit's Content Policy**\n1. Pretty simple. Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, incite violence, etc. Find the content policy [here] (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). If you disagree with this, take it up with the admins, because we have no say in them.\n\n\n###**II. Don't be a cunt**\n\n1. Also simple. If you come to this sub to be a cunt and to argue about politics, religion, etc in an uncivil way, then you will be banned. This is a shitposting sub dammit, not r/politics.\n\n\n###**III. Shitposts 😃 God awful posts 😡**\n\n1. This subreddit is for shitposts, not gawdawfulposts. and yes, repost chains/blatant karmawhoring posts are godawfulposts, not shitposts. Posting literal shit=ban. [Due to the poll addressing user complaints](https://redd.it/piumy6) the following are now being removed: unoriginal comment baiting posts (AMA, start arguing, ask questions and edit) and CUM spam. \n\n\n###**IV. Mod discretion**\n\n1. Mods have final say on what content stays or goes. Pursuant to Comb. Civ. C. §22SA{g}{i} We reserve the right to ban users for making our subreddit terrible\n\n\n###**V. Kevin**\n\n1. Kevin\n\n\n###**VI. No excessive spamming**\n\n1. Pretty easy. Don't spam posts or comments. We are a shitposting sub, but we have *some*, miniscule, standards.\n\n\n###**VII. Number 7**\n\n1. A Bangledeshi 20 year old student was arrested after watching porn, stripping naked and attacking an attendant during a flight. In March 2018, shortly after the Malindo Air flight departed from Kuala Lumpur, the 20 year old started watching pornography on his laptop. As no one seemed to notice or call him out for it, the man began taking his clothes off. At the request of the cabin crew, the student put his clothes back on. But soon, he tried to hug female flight attendants.\n\n\n###**VIII. Really, seriously, don’t be a cunt**\n\n1. That whole “don’t be a cunt” thing, just don’t\n\n\n###**IX. Properly mark NSFW and spoilers**\n\n1. im at work 😡what if my boss sees boobies on my screen 🤬. \"idk if it's nsfw/a spoiler or not\" then just mark it anyways.\n\n\n###**X. Videos must not exceed 1-ish minutes**\n\n1.

No compilation videos, gifs, pictures, etc.\n\n9. **No Fundraising/Request/Donation Posts.** This includes any post or comment asking for people to perform a 'bro' action. Examples include: attending funerals, mailing cards, petitions, joining livestreams, and GoFundMe campaigns. Moderators will ban those violating this rule.\n\n10. **No spreading misinformation.** Sharing a source and debating that source or topic in a fair and reasonable manner (i.e., without personal attacks) is encouraged.

Simple as that. If you have a problem with our decision, [send us a message.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor)\n\n If you're trying to troll, your post will be immediately removed and your account will be banned. This includes tricks where you try to get someone to google something different than what they expect. \n\n 2B.  **A social media screenshot that is *solely* about one personality responding to another personality is not necessarily humor**, and might be better suited for subreddits such as /r/CleverComebacks or /r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter . Anything that can be described as a \"flame war, slapfight, clap-back, or sick burn\" or anything remotely similar is not appropriate for this subreddit.  It MUST contain humor to be allowed here.\n\n\n3. **Pictures of only text are not allowed.** \n\n    Pictures of text with no graphics will be removed. No, changing the color of the background is not a graphic. Screenshots of social media and satire websites are allowed. \n\n4. **Images &amp; short GIFs only.**\n\n    Linking to news articles, websites or videos is prohibited.\n\n    Gifs are allowed as long as they are no longer than 10 seconds and contain NO audio.  \n\n    Images must directly link to the content you're posting. Please use Reddit's image host or [imgur](https://imgur.com/) if you can.\n\n   Any other content, including META posts, videos, advertisements and blog posts will be removed. Any of this disallowed content hiding within \"allowed\" content may be met with further action at moderator discretion.\n\n  Any meta posts should be posted on our special [complaint forum](https://i.imgur.com/FOKLgfe.png). Don't post them here. \n\n5. **Avoid reposts, flooding, and spam.** \n\n Use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) or [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) and check /new and the front page before you post. Unfortunately, due to recent Reddit changes, karmadecay is not as effective, so we have a pretty light hand with repost violations and are not likely to ban you if you make a mistake. \n\n Do not post more than 4 posts in a 24 hour period.  \n\n6. **Be civil: No racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.** \n\n  The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team. \n\n  Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance. \n\n  If you're a jerk, including use of \"tard\" or anything related to a racial supremacist ideology, you'll be shown the door. \n\n  If you're intentionally trolling, including \"google games,\" you will be banned. \n\n7. **Do not brigade.** \n\n  Coming to this community en masse specifically to harass our users, or setting up a post or thread here referring to another subreddit or thread causes a lot of problems for everyone. If we suspect you're doing it, you will be banned. \n\n ___7b.___  **No \"Meta\" Posts.**\n\n Meta posts about this subreddit, or posts referencing any other subreddit are not allowed due to sitewide rules and brigading problems. This includes links to, or screen-shots of any other subreddit and or any other sub's comment section.\n\n\n8. **Follow Reddit's global rules.** Submissions failing to follow [Reddit's content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) will be removed. Basically, if you are trying to sell your T-Shirts or flip flops or sexbot site, or if you're a terrorist, you're gonna be booted. \n\n9. **No pointing at offsite resources**\n\n  Due to spam and foreign disinformation campaigns that have targeted Reddit in the past (including /r/PoliticalHumor in 2015-2016), we are banning any images that reference or bear the image of Facebook groups, other watermarks, or individual websites not ranked highly on Alexa Website Rankings.\n\n  This includes screenshots of dubious news sites, watermarks, and certain social media accounts posing as something they are not. This does NOT include political cartoons, screenshots of individual Twitter posts, or established satirical websites.\n\n###Enforcement Policy \n\n\n* **Moderators will enforce the rules at their sole discretion.** \n\n* You may ask for clarification of a removal by [messaging the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor) with a link to your post or comment. \n\n* To appeal a ban, respond to your original ban message.

Artists are encouraged to post their own work.  News and media for adaptations based on comic books are welcome. Read [the subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/wiki/index) for more information about the subreddit.\n\n\n##[General Conduct](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_general_conduct)\n\n&gt; 1. **[Don't complain about comics you don't like or understand.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_1._don.27t_complain_about_comics_you_don.27t_like.)** - If you don't get a comic, it's probably not meant for you. Comics are often targeted at certain audiences. If you don't get a comic, odds are it wasn't meant for you. Don't whine about it; just move on to the next comic.\n2. **[Don't attack artists posting their content.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_2._don.27t_attack_artists_posting_their_content)** - It's not ok to attack artists with hateful comments meant to tear them down or try to chase them off Reddit. \n3. **[Don't make drama for drama's sake. No trolling.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_3._don.27t_make_drama_for_drama.27s_sake._no_trolling.)** - Anyone wanting to participate in this community needs to keep their comments civil.  No hateful comments or posts - Any comments or posts that are racist, mysogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, misinformation or extremist in nature will be removed and will result in an immediate ban.\n4. **[Respect the [OC] System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_4._respect_the_.5Boc.5D_system)** - The [OC] tag is for artists wanting to submit their Original Content.  False claims on others' art will get you banned.\n5. **[Respect the Report System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_5._respect_the_report_system)** - Reports are for content that breaks this sub's/Reddit's rules.  False reports are given to the Reddit Admins. \n6. **[Tag NSFW content when needed.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_6._tag_nsfw_content_when_needed.)** - Content with nudity, pornography, or obvious profanity should be tagged as NSFW.  \n\n##[What is OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_ok_to_post)\n\n&gt; * **Comic covers or short excerpts** - *A few* scanned pages can be posted for discussion.  Don't post entire comic books.  Posts with too many pages will get removed.\n* **Web comic strips** - Most strips need to be linked back to original sources (i.e. the artists' websites).   Don't link to [rehosted](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_rehosting) or [hotlinked](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_hotlinking) comics. Artists can use [OC] to link to their own work anywhere.\n* **Links to articles, videos, art, cosplay or music** - Content directly related to comic books or web comics, including film and TV media.  \n* **Discussion topics** - Talk about past or present comic books or strips.  Topics about comic-based movies or TV shows are also fine.\n* **Translations** - English translations of non-English original comics are ok as long as the translation is honest and a link to the original source is provided in a comment.\n\n##[What is not OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_not_ok_to_post)\n\n&gt; * **Edits to comics that you didn't make** - Don't remove watermarks/attribution or try to \"fix\" someone else's work.  Post your own original content.\n* **Stuff that just reminds you of comics without there being any real reference in the topic** - Please keep posts on topic with real comic content.\n* **Links to download complete, pirated comic books** - Please support comics by buying them.\n\n\n##[Are You A Comic Artist?](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_are_you_a_comic_artist.3F)\n\n&gt; Content creators can get Artist Flair to display next to their account names on all of their posts. [Message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FComics) with some proof and the name of your strip for some blue flair.

No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned.

No \"talking head\" videos|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned.

Don't be a dick\nIt's not hard, just be nice to each other.\n\n###2. No hateful insults\nDon't post hateful insults\n\n###3. No reposts\nDon't repost. Please refer to our [common repost album.](https://imgur.com/a/8XDVQtt)\n\n###4. Not a rare insult/threat\n/r/rareinsults is not for unfunny/common insults, this includes insults that follow the random [adjective]+[noun] formula. It is only for rare insults. No other post types are allowed\n\nCorporate insults also fall under this category. [Click here to learn more!](https://redd.it/ghj57g)\n\n###5. No personal information\nPersonal information includes full names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, and usernames\n\n###6. No politics\nPolitical submissions will be removed and posters will be permanently banned.\n\nThis includes mention of politicians, political commentators, and political movements\n\n###7. All posts require a proper title\nNo low effort titles or titles that contain the insult. Examples are \"for those sorting by new\" or \"lmao he called this dude a deformed shrimp.\"\n\nIf your post is removed for another reason and you repost, do not title your post \"reposting because it was removed.\"\n\n###8. No long videos (&gt;10s) or long texts\nDon't post long videos and don't post long texts. If the entirety of the long text is an insult, then it belongs on /r/murderedbywords, and if it is a long text with only a small insult buried inside the text, it will be removed.\n\n###9. No image macros/memes\nPosting memes or images with text on them(image macros) aren't allowed as they detract from the main point of the subreddit, which is rare insults. Memes are off-topic and belong in other subreddits.\n\n###10. No crossposts\n\n###11. No r/RoastMe\nInsults from r/RoastMe are not allowed, as people have time to sit and think of clever insults rather than coming up with them in the moment.\n\n###12. Moderators' Discretion\n\nModerators reserve the right to remove any post they deem unfit for the subreddit, even if it doesn't explicitly break any rules. This rule will only be used in specific ways, such as one/two word posts, posts in different languages, etc. This is extremely subjective and mostly up to the judgement of the mods using it, so if you disagree with this rule being used to remove your post, let us know using [modmail](/message/compose/?to=/r/rareinsults)\n\n[](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"rareinsults","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Zhwk3hcVO2qCD3oL6A6oYdskQzcwGKQUNRGa4clt4Tg.png","title":"r/RareInsults","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#7193ff","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wWCY2qH6nBLeYtLIxWMMSzNKNVAgZqoGnsBQTV4RwWs.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a rare insult","header_size":[96,96],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":2334678,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/rareinsults","key_color":"#ff4500","name":"t5_48t85","created":1510880378,"url":"/r/rareinsults/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1510880378,"banner_size":[735,220],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Did you stumble across a unique insult?
