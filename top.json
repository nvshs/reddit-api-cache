Most submissions do not make the cut, so please do not treat removals under Rule 2 as personal attacks: They are simply the results of our content model.\n\n[](/starlightrage)\n##See something that breaks our rules?  \n\n###Use the report button and remember to choose a reason for reporting.\n\n---\n     \n### Rules - **[hover or click here for full version](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/expanded)**\n\n|||\n|:------|:-----|\n|1. Do not alter headlines; copy and paste. | The title of all submissions needs to match the article headline exactly.  **Copy and paste** from the main headline only, do not include anything beyond the primary headline such as byliners, subtitles, flavor text, quotes from the article, news outlet, location, cross post tags, (video) tags, and so on.  Do not use the “suggest title” option for posting as it often does not match the headline.  As a matter of fairness, any submission with an altered title will be removed.  The **only exception** is that, if an article has a title in **all caps**, you may change the capitalization to title case, but everything else must remain the same.|\n|2. Submit only if “Oniony”. | Please consider submitting your article to /r/OffBeat or similar subreddits unless it truly reads like The Onion wrote it. The title and article itself must both be \"Oniony\". This can be highly subjective; you are encouraged to upvote articles that should be here and downvote those that should not.  Moderators can also remove posts at their own discretion under this rule.  [More here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/done_to_death)|\n|3. Must be a news article. | Submissions must be in the form of a news article.  Videos are only allowed if they are accompanied by a complete text article.  Editorials, blogs, twitter posts, image galleries, tabloid stories, youtube videos, meta posts, static images, articles with fewer than 5 sentences, and so forth will be removed.|\n|4. Use original, reliable sources. | Find the source of your story before you submit it, simply by checking for references or googling the subject to locate the original piece.  Websites that frequently re-host viral news stories or contain misleading information are on [automatic removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval).  Blogs are not reliable sources.|\n|5. Do not repost similar articles. | Check the sub for your story before you submit it; if it’s already here then please vote and comment there instead of posting another version.  Similar stories will be removed and frequent re-posters will lose their posting privileges.  Do not delete and repost your own submissions without approval.|\n|6. No satire articles. | Even if they are technically from a source other than _The Onion_, any article submission written as satire or even true stories written in a satirical manner are not allowed.  Please note that some major news outlets have satirical sections, such as the Borowitz Report on the New Yorker, which are also not allowed.  Meanwhile, AVClub, while owned by The Onion, is not satire and is allowed. If you'd like, you can use a tool like http://realorsatire.com/ to see if your submission is from a known satirical website.|\n|7. No tabloid journalism. | Do not post tabloid news stories, or articles that source from tabloid news outlets (TheSun, Mirror, Dailymail, People, TMZ, etc).|\n|8. No old news. | Articles need to have been written within two weeks of its submission date.|\n|9. English articles only. | Please do not post non-English articles.  Do not use google translate for submission either; rather try to find an English version of the story by a secondary source.|\n|10. No mobile versions. | If you’re using a mobile device to post a story make sure you remove any mobile identifiers (typically “.m” or “mobile”) from the url before submitting.|\n|11. No blocked or redirected links. | Please ensure you aren’t submitting a link that utilizes a paywall or survey wall (nytimes.com, thetimes.co.uk) in order gain access to the complete article.  Do not submit links that redirect you to another site to read the article and do not submit using link shorteners either.|\n\n[](/sunburstnervous) **[Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval) to view a list of sites deemed unreliable by our moderator team.**\n\n###See [our FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/nto101) for more information on our rules. \n____\n\n###Keep all comments civil.\n\n[](/twirage) Personal attacks, racism, bigotry, homophobia, grandstanding, misinformation, conspiracy theories, etc. will not be tolerated and ***you will be banned***.\n\n[Witch hunting or brigading is not allowed.

Artists are encouraged to post their own work.  News and media for adaptations based on comic books are welcome. Read [the subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/wiki/index) for more information about the subreddit.\n\n\n##[General Conduct](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_general_conduct)\n\n&gt; 1. **[Don't complain about comics you don't like or understand.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_1._don.27t_complain_about_comics_you_don.27t_like.)** - If you don't get a comic, it's probably not meant for you. Comics are often targeted at certain audiences. If you don't get a comic, odds are it wasn't meant for you. Don't whine about it; just move on to the next comic.\n2. **[Don't attack artists posting their content.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_2._don.27t_attack_artists_posting_their_content)** - It's not ok to attack artists with hateful comments meant to tear them down or try to chase them off Reddit. \n3. **[Don't make drama for drama's sake. No trolling.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_3._don.27t_make_drama_for_drama.27s_sake._no_trolling.)** - Anyone wanting to participate in this community needs to keep their comments civil.  No hateful comments or posts - Any comments or posts that are racist, mysogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, misinformation or extremist in nature will be removed and will result in an immediate ban.\n4. **[Respect the [OC] System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_4._respect_the_.5Boc.5D_system)** - The [OC] tag is for artists wanting to submit their Original Content.  False claims on others' art will get you banned.\n5. **[Respect the Report System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_5._respect_the_report_system)** - Reports are for content that breaks this sub's/Reddit's rules.  False reports are given to the Reddit Admins. \n6. **[Tag NSFW content when needed.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_6._tag_nsfw_content_when_needed.)** - Content with nudity, pornography, or obvious profanity should be tagged as NSFW.  \n\n##[What is OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_ok_to_post)\n\n&gt; * **Comic covers or short excerpts** - *A few* scanned pages can be posted for discussion.  Don't post entire comic books.  Posts with too many pages will get removed.\n* **Web comic strips** - Most strips need to be linked back to original sources (i.e. the artists' websites).   Don't link to [rehosted](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_rehosting) or [hotlinked](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_hotlinking) comics. Artists can use [OC] to link to their own work anywhere.\n* **Links to articles, videos, art, cosplay or music** - Content directly related to comic books or web comics, including film and TV media.  \n* **Discussion topics** - Talk about past or present comic books or strips.  Topics about comic-based movies or TV shows are also fine.\n* **Translations** - English translations of non-English original comics are ok as long as the translation is honest and a link to the original source is provided in a comment.\n\n##[What is not OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_not_ok_to_post)\n\n&gt; * **Edits to comics that you didn't make** - Don't remove watermarks/attribution or try to \"fix\" someone else's work.  Post your own original content.\n* **Stuff that just reminds you of comics without there being any real reference in the topic** - Please keep posts on topic with real comic content.\n* **Links to download complete, pirated comic books** - Please support comics by buying them.\n\n\n##[Are You A Comic Artist?](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_are_you_a_comic_artist.3F)\n\n&gt; Content creators can get Artist Flair to display next to their account names on all of their posts. [Message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FComics) with some proof and the name of your strip for some blue flair.  Artists without flair can add [OC] to post titles to identify their \"Original Content.\" Tagging a post with [OC] allows links to general hosting sites like Imgur.\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp;\n    \n&gt; [ ](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23comics \"flair-talk\")\n\n##Related Subreddits\n\n&gt; * /r/comicbooks\n* /r/webcomics\n* /r/manga\n* /r/graphicnovels\n* /r/comicbookart\n* /r/comiccon\n* /r/comic_crits\n* /r/wholesomecomics \n* /r/webtoons \n* /r/comicbookshelves.\n* [Marvel Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/marvel)\n* [DC Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/dc)\n* [Image Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/image)\n* [Vertigo Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/vertigo)\n* [Dark Horse Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/darkhorse)\n* [Valiant Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/valiant)\n* [Manga Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/manga)\n* [Other Comics-Related Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/other)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"comics","header_img":"https://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/uIbyX8MSVa0J6mKV.png","title":"Print Comics and Webcomics ","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":null,"primary_color":"","icon_img":"","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[175,40],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":2133596,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/comics","key_color":"#0079d3","name":"t5_2qh0s","created":1201219852,"url":"/r/comics/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1201219852,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Everything related to print comics (comic books, graphic novels, and strips) and web comics.

Please search or look through BPT's older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts.\n\n8.) No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you think of something acceptable/reasonable. **Don't put the punchline in the title of the post**. Do not add \"bruh\", \"fam\", or similar vernacular to your post or comment.\n\n9.) Don't complain about [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) or slang. Use [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com) if you do not understand the meaning of a word. Comments asking \"what does x mean?\" will be removed. \n\n\n10.) BPT is an inclusive space for POC and allies alike.  This sub highlights minority viewpoints, through humor, commentary, or criticism.  Please respect these voices and show you care about black opinions as much as you care about black humor.\n \n11.) Don't post things from meme/corporate accounts.

No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you…\" or \"When they…\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed.
