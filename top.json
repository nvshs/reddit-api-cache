Don’t violate Reddit's Content Policy**\n1. Pretty simple. Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, incite violence, etc. Find the content policy [here] (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). If you disagree with this, take it up with the admins, because we have no say in them.\n\n\n###**II. Don't be a cunt**\n\n1. Also simple. If you come to this sub to be a cunt and to argue about politics, religion, etc in an uncivil way, then you will be banned. This is a shitposting sub dammit, not r/politics.\n\n\n###**III. Shitposts 😃 God awful posts 😡**\n\n1. This subreddit is for shitposts, not gawdawfulposts. and yes, repost chains/blatant karmawhoring posts are godawfulposts, not shitposts. Posting literal shit=ban. [Due to the poll addressing user complaints](https://redd.it/piumy6) the following are now being removed: unoriginal comment baiting posts (AMA, start arguing, ask questions and edit) and CUM spam. \n\n\n###**IV. Mod discretion**\n\n1. Mods have final say on what content stays or goes. Pursuant to Comb. Civ. C. §22SA{g}{i} We reserve the right to ban users for making our subreddit terrible\n\n\n###**V. Kevin**\n\n1. Kevin\n\n\n###**VI. No excessive spamming**\n\n1. Pretty easy. Don't spam posts or comments. We are a shitposting sub, but we have *some*, miniscule, standards.\n\n\n###**VII. Number 7**\n\n1. A Bangledeshi 20 year old student was arrested after watching porn, stripping naked and attacking an attendant during a flight. In March 2018, shortly after the Malindo Air flight departed from Kuala Lumpur, the 20 year old started watching pornography on his laptop. As no one seemed to notice or call him out for it, the man began taking his clothes off. At the request of the cabin crew, the student put his clothes back on. But soon, he tried to hug female flight attendants.\n\n\n###**VIII. Really, seriously, don’t be a cunt**\n\n1. That whole “don’t be a cunt” thing, just don’t\n\n\n###**IX. Properly mark NSFW and spoilers**\n\n1. im at work 😡what if my boss sees boobies on my screen 🤬. \"idk if it's nsfw/a spoiler or not\" then just mark it anyways.\n\n\n###**X. Videos must not exceed 1-ish minutes**\n\n1.

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you…\" or \"When they…\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed. Try /r/NSFWfunny. Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social media or electronic messaging content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed. This includes anything from Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, or any form of \"comments section\" on the Internet, as well as [content accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Images with SnapChat text added are allowed, as long as all UI elements have been removed.

They will be deleted regardless of intent. This is an anti-spam measure.\n\n* All submissions to /r/Funny are governed by [Reddit's policies on self-promotion and spam](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).\n\n------\n\n|||\n|-|-|\n|What do I do if I see a post that breaks the rules?|Click on the report button, and [send us a message](/message/compose?to=%23funny) with a link to the comments of the post.|\n|What should I do if I don't see my post in the new queue?|If your submission isn't showing up, please don't just delete it as that makes the filter hate you!

Submissions must be something you saw that was odd and out of the ordinary for your work setting. Only original content is acceptable. Do not post pictures taken by others.  Automotive and Non-automotive mechanical failure/oddities ONLY. Examples of this include computers, HVAC, aircraft, helicopters, etc. Animals do not fall under the guidelines of Rule #1.\n\n2. Posts need not be automotive related, but must follow rule 1.\n\n3. This is not a place to ask for help troubleshooting your vehicles issues. You can instead post these to our sister subreddit: /r/MechanicAdvice. Posts of this nature will be removed.\n\n4. If it's not obvious, please include a detailed description of what the problem is or what the thing in the picture does/is supposed to do.\n\n5. No memes or rage comics. \n\n6. Do not link photos from Facebook.  If you have a photo from FB you want to post, upload it into [Imgur](http://imgur.com/) then post from there.  Linking from FB causes security issues for the persons profile.\n\n7. Please mark pictures with blood/gore/sexually natured as NSFW.\n\n8. Please cover or remove license plate numbers, VINs, phone numbers, and names.\n\n9. Do not post a \"spotted picture\" /r/Spotted,  /r/JRITSlounge, or /r/SeenOnTheStreet  are the proper places for those posts. Any offending posts will be deleted, this rule will be enforced with extreme prejudice. \n\n10. Discussions and questions that promote discussion are allowed, but questions cannot be of an /r/MechanicAdvice nature.  For example, \"What is the worst customer experience you've had?\" is allowed while \"What's wrong with my car?\" is not.  \n\n11. Absolutely no sale site posts.  This includes Craigslist, Ebay, Facebook sale groups, etc.  For more explanation, see rule 1. \n\n12. Trend posts or \"karma trains\" will be regulated at the discretion of the moderators, as they often lead to rule breaking when they get out of hand. \n\n--&gt; If you do not see your submitted post in \"new\" within 5 minutes, message the mods with the URL to your submission and we can fish it out of the spam filter for you.\n\nVisit our friends!:\n=============\n\n/r/JRITSlounge\n\n/r/JRITSmod\n\n____________\n\n/r/airframeandpowerplant\n\n/r/AskAShittyMechanic\n\n/r/AutoDetailing\n\n/r/AutomotiveLearning \n\n/r/AutomotiveTraining\n\n/r/carporn\n\n/r/cartalk\n\n/r/coolcarsforsale\n\n/r/Diesel\n\n/r/drivermacgyver\n\n/r/ElCamino\n\n/r/EngineBuilding \n\n/r/Hookit\n\n/r/localcarenthusiasts/\n\n/r/machinists\n\n/r/MechanicAdvice\n\n/r/manufacturing\n\n/r/partscounter\n\n/r/projectcar\n\n/r/RandomActsOfMechanics\n\n/r/ratbikes\n\n/r/RatRod\n\n/r/Riced\n\n/r/scrapheap\n\n/r/SeenOnTheStreet\n\n/r/shitty_car_mods\n\n/r/Skookum \n\n/r/Spotted (full vehicles only, no random junkers or car parts)\n\n/r/toolboxmods\n\n/r/toolporn\n\n/r/Welding \n\n/r/WeirdWheels\n\n/r/WorkBoots\n_________\n\n/r/Datsun \n\n/r/Fiat\n\n/r/jaguar\n\n/r/Jeep\n\n/r/Mazda\n\n/r/peugeot\n\n/r/Saab\n\n/r/s10 \n\n/r/Camaro\n\n/r/ChevyCorsica","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"Justrolledintotheshop","header_img":"https://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/5bkRocO5lnaqAYaz.png","title":"Just Rolled Into the Shop","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":null,"primary_color":"#373c3f","icon_img":"","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a new failure picture","header_size":[112,128],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":1966621,"submit_text_label":"Submit a new failure story","link_flair_position":"right","display_name_prefixed":"r/Justrolledintotheshop","key_color":"#0079d3","name":"t5_2tteh","created":1333059756,"url":"/r/Justrolledintotheshop/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1333059756,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"For those absolutely stupid things that you see people bring, roll, or toss into your place of business and the people that bring them in.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"Baking","title":"Poliwag roll cake, took me over 5 tries to get right, but I'm really proud of it","ups":62957,"post_hint":"hosted:video","media":{"reddit_video":{"bitrate_kbps":4800,"fallback_url":"https://v.redd.it/tq360w8kthna1/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback","height":1080,"width":608,"scrubber_media_url":"https://v.redd.it/tq360w8kthna1/DASH_96.mp4","dash_url":"https://v.redd.it/tq360w8kthna1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1681353058%2CMWI1M2EzOTI0NDNiNzFiZWMwMjk4NzJjY2UxZDk0NGUyMjkxMjc5YzE4YTdmY2MzMTM1ZjE5ZjM3ZTc1ZGZiNg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","duration":13,"hls_url":"https://v.redd.it/tq360w8kthna1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1681353058%2CNjAwY2NjN2MyYmVhYmZjMDBmYWEyZWEzMTNiMzkwZTg5ZWU3ZGFjMWNmM2UzODg1MjAxM2Y4OTBlY2U4YWM3YQ%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","is_gif":false,"transcoding_status":"completed"}},"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2qx1h/styles/communityIcon_bpprg3isxj851.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6d908b81a2ec71c4030f1de48e1b99adbef4373f","show_media":true,"description":"---\n\nFor all your baking needs!\nRecipes, ideas and all things baking related.\n\nCakes, cookies, pies, tarts, muffins, scones, short- rye- wheat- and naan breads welcome!

Don't post entire comic books.  Posts with too many pages will get removed.\n* **Web comic strips** - Most strips need to be linked back to original sources (i.e. the artists' websites).   Don't link to [rehosted](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_rehosting) or [hotlinked](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_hotlinking) comics. Artists can use [OC] to link to their own work anywhere.\n* **Links to articles, videos, art, cosplay or music** - Content directly related to comic books or web comics, including film and TV media.  \n* **Discussion topics** - Talk about past or present comic books or strips.  Topics about comic-based movies or TV shows are also fine.\n* **Translations** - English translations of non-English original comics are ok as long as the translation is honest and a link to the original source is provided in a comment.\n\n##[What is not OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_not_ok_to_post)\n\n&gt; * **Edits to comics that you didn't make** - Don't remove watermarks/attribution or try to \"fix\" someone else's work.  Post your own original content.\n* **Stuff that just reminds you of comics without there being any real reference in the topic** - Please keep posts on topic with real comic content.\n* **Links to download complete, pirated comic books** - Please support comics by buying them.\n\n\n##[Are You A Comic Artist?](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_are_you_a_comic_artist.3F)\n\n&gt; Content creators can get Artist Flair to display next to their account names on all of their posts. [Message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FComics) with some proof and the name of your strip for some blue flair.  Artists without flair can add [OC] to post titles to identify their \"Original Content.\" Tagging a post with [OC] allows links to general hosting sites like Imgur.\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp;\n    \n&gt; [ ](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23comics \"flair-talk\")\n\n##Related Subreddits\n\n&gt; * /r/comicbooks\n* /r/webcomics\n* /r/manga\n* /r/graphicnovels\n* /r/comicbookart\n* /r/comiccon\n* /r/comic_crits\n* /r/wholesomecomics \n* /r/webtoons \n* /r/comicbookshelves.\n* [Marvel Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/marvel)\n* [DC Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/dc)\n* [Image Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/image)\n* [Vertigo Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/vertigo)\n* [Dark Horse Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/darkhorse)\n* [Valiant Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/valiant)\n* [Manga Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/manga)\n* [Other Comics-Related Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/other)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"comics","header_img":"https://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/uIbyX8MSVa0J6mKV.png","title":"Print Comics and Webcomics ","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":null,"primary_color":"","icon_img":"","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[175,40],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":2125045,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/comics","key_color":"#0079d3","name":"t5_2qh0s","created":1201219852,"url":"/r/comics/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1201219852,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Everything related to print comics (comic books, graphic novels, and strips) and web comics.
