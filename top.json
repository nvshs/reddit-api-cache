This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).\n####What does \"Oddly Satisfying\" mean?\nWe are forever searching for a \"true definition\". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* \"oddly satisfying\" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.\n\n***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**\n\n######Rules:\n**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**\n###1)  **Banned Topics:**\nWe have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:\n\n* **Memes or image macros**\n\n* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as \"2048\", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.\n\n* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.\n\n* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).\n\n* **Compilation Albums/Videos**\n  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**\n  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).\n  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.\n\n* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.\n\n* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. \n\n###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** \nNSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (\"Say it, don't show it.\"). \n\n###3)  **Reposts:** \n**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.\n\n* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.\n\n* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as \"My...\", \"Mine...\", \"Our...\", \"We...\", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.\n\n###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** \nPlease cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.\n\n* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**\n* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)\n\n###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**\n\n* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: \n  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing &amp; ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.\n\n###8) **Reddiquette, Comments &amp; Subreddit Behavior:**\n\n* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.\n* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.\n* The definition of what truly is \"Oddly Satisfying\" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.\n\n###9) **Crossposts**\n* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma. \n\n#####Related subreddits:\n* /r/ArtisanVideos \n\n* /r/asmr \n\n* /r/clonedgif \n\n* /r/interestingasfuck \n\n* /r/knolling \n\n* /r/loadingicon \n\n* /r/lookscool \n\n* /r/mesmerizinggifs \n\n* /r/mildlyinfuriating \n\n* /r/mildlyinteresting \n\n* r/OrganizationPorn \n\n* /r/parasnailing \n\n* /r/perfectfit \n\n* /r/perfectLoops \n\n* /r/pic \n\n* /r/powerwashingporn \n\n* /r/satisfyinggrass\n\n* /r/showerthoughts \n\n* /r/simulated \n\n* /r/slightlyunsatisfying \n\n* /r/SlyGifs   \n\n* /r/ThatPeelingFeeling\n\n* /r/ThisBlewMyMind \n\n* /r/WtWFotMJaJtRAtCaB [SFW]","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"oddlysatisfying","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6NYespd3jy62IgAehgvHjNFg8z9zBIlFefIn2ZrF5oQ.png","title":"Oddly Satisfying","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#00a6a5","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/65GJujMgAXbydbxxFPYm6eck1YffqR-anhX4-hxnVhQ.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[115,120],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9344304,"submit_text_label":"Texty-text text","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/oddlysatisfying","key_color":"#ff66ac","name":"t5_2x93b","created":1368595528,"url":"/r/oddlysatisfying/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1368595528,"banner_size":[1280,384],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"For those little things that are inexplicably satisfying.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"interestingasfuck","title":"I made my pup Olive this tennis ball catapult","ups":88354,"post_hint":"hosted:video","media":{"reddit_video":{"bitrate_kbps":1200,"fallback_url":"https://v.redd.it/2qihcejcgoua1/DASH_480.mp4?source=fallback","height":480,"width":672,"scrubber_media_url":"https://v.redd.it/2qihcejcgoua1/DASH_96.mp4","dash_url":"https://v.redd.it/2qihcejcgoua1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1684476039%2CMDliNTg1NjdjZmQ3OTY0ZGY5NTI5NTllOWQ4YzdmYzNmNDM5NWY0ZjY1OGZmOWJlYzJkN2IwMzVhMzZkZjgxNg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","duration":9,"hls_url":"https://v.redd.it/2qihcejcgoua1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1684476039%2CMjkyMmM4MmQ1NDQwYjVhNzQ5OTUyNjUzZGU4OGMyNzVlNzIzMzBiZjIyNjgzNjU4ODJlYzFkZDVjNTQ5MDJhYQ%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","is_gif":false,"transcoding_status":"completed"}},"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2qhsa/styles/communityIcon_5v3bepmshpg81.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2914ade77dd2525043d2a30b44aad9ea0a38c0b9","show_media":true,"description":"---\n\nA place to share (almost) anything and everything interesting as fuck.\n\n---\n\n# [Rules (click for more details on the rules)](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)\n\n\n|||\n|:------|:---|\n|1.

Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title.

Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed.
