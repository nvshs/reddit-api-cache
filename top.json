[Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you‚Ä¶\" or \"When they‚Ä¶\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here.

Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration.

No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

No Reposts**\nMake sure you aren't submitting a post that has already been submitted. It's a good idea to browse our top 100 posts of all time to avoid making this mistake and to familiarize yourself with the subreddit. Frequent reposting may result in a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n**2. No Advertising**\nWhile you are allowed to post your own content on this subreddit (which MUST use the flair \"OC\"), do not post videos with the title advertising your TikTok page. This includes phrases such as \"follow me, like my TikTok, etc.\" No linking your TikTok page in comments unless it is under your own video. This will result in your post/comment being immediately deleted. Blatant advertisement trying to get views or followers for yourself/others will result in a permanent ban.\n\n**3. Flair Posts Correctly**\nAll posts must be marked and flaired correctly. This makes it easier for users to sort by flair to see the content they are looking for. If a moderator feels your post is not flaired correctly, the flair may be changed or the post may be removed.\n\n**4. All Original Content MUST be Flaired as Such**\nAlong with rule 3, all original content posted MUST use the ‚ÄúOC‚Äù flair. We would like our users to know if you created the video you posted. This also helps prevent self advertisement and spam. Users not following this rule should be reported immediately and will receive a one month ban.\n\n**5. Posts Must Be From TikTok**\nAll posts must be directly from TikTok. This means that you can clearly see the original creator's username as well as the TikTok logo in the corner of the video. Any video with the original poster's username cut out will not be considered a TikTok. Violation of this rule may result in a temporary ban.\n\n**6. No Posting of Personal Information**\nDo not post any personal information. This includes real names, phone numbers, addresses, etc. This may result in a permanent ban.\n\n**7. Don't Witch-hunt**\nDo not call for the heads of anyone displayed in anything posted here. This will result in an immediate and permanent ban.\n\n**8. No Being Deliberately Rude, Vulgar, or Offensive to Others in Comments**\nDo not go out of your way to put down other members of the community in the comment section of a post. This may result in a permanent ban. If you see someone breaking this rule, simply report them and move on. No need to respond and get yourself banned as well.\n\n**9. Hate Speech**\nThere will be zero tolerance for explicit racism, homophobia/transphobia, or sexism/misogyny. Engaging in any sort of hate speech will result in the post or comment being removed and you will receive a permanent ban.\n\n**10. No Bad-Faith Posts Featuring Anyone Who is Mentally Ill or Disabled**\nNo content is allowed that focuses on people who are mentally ill or disabled. This will result in an immediate and permanent ban.\n\n**11. No Compilations/YouTube Video Re-uploads**\nThis is not a place to post compilations. Posting compilations may result in a permanent ban.\n\nUploading videos that are clearly YouTube videos (SNL skits, Video game highlights, etc) are not allowed. Even if you found it on TikTok, do not post ripped unedited YouTube video-TikToks here. This may result in a temporary ban.\n\n**12. Don't Complain About the Subreddit Name**\nThe subreddit evolved long ago last it's roots of \"only cringe-worthy\" content. There have been two community polls where over 85% of users agreed to include all content. It's come to the point where users who say \"This isn't cringe\" or anything of that sort, may receive a temporary ban. We have made this clear enough with a pinned comment on every single post.\n\n**13. All Political Posts MUST be Flaired as Such**\nAll political posts must be flaired as \"politics.\" Failure to do so will result in a temporary ban.\n\n**14. No spamming/irrelevant gif replies**\nBecause we are apart of reddit's POWERUPS program, users are able to reply to posts/comments with gifs. Anyone seen spamming or posting gifs completely irrelevant to the post or comment in question will receive a temporary ban.","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"TikTokCringe","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PkhK2qIsp9RQlT-dqKqjDY4k6k40k_fi_pjqqH7b5NQ.png","title":"The Best and Worst of TikTok","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":null,"primary_color":"#b33bd8","icon_img":"","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a TikTok Video","header_size":[91,100],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":1654579,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/TikTokCringe","key_color":"#7e53c1","name":"t5_mvcq5","created":1533622973,"url":"/r/TikTokCringe/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1533622973,"banner_size":[1280,384],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"A place to watch the best and worst videos from TikTok.\n\nHere you can find TikToks that are cringe-worthy, funny, wholesome, and more!

No long videos (&gt;10s) or long texts\nDon't post long videos and don't post long texts. If the entirety of the long text is an insult, then it belongs on /r/murderedbywords, and if it is a long text with only a small insult buried inside the text, it will be removed.\n\n###9. No image macros/memes\nPosting memes or images with text on them(image macros) aren't allowed as they detract from the main point of the subreddit, which is rare insults. Memes are off-topic and belong in other subreddits.\n\n###10. No crossposts\n\n###11. No r/RoastMe\nInsults from r/RoastMe are not allowed, as people have time to sit and think of clever insults rather than coming up with them in the moment.\n\n###12. Moderators' Discretion\n\nModerators reserve the right to remove any post they deem unfit for the subreddit, even if it doesn't explicitly break any rules. This rule will only be used in specific ways, such as one/two word posts, posts in different languages, etc. This is extremely subjective and mostly up to the judgement of the mods using it, so if you disagree with this rule being used to remove your post, let us know using [modmail](/message/compose/?to=/r/rareinsults)\n\n[](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"rareinsults","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Zhwk3hcVO2qCD3oL6A6oYdskQzcwGKQUNRGa4clt4Tg.png","title":"r/RareInsults","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#7193ff","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wWCY2qH6nBLeYtLIxWMMSzNKNVAgZqoGnsBQTV4RwWs.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a rare insult","header_size":[96,96],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":2344789,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/rareinsults","key_color":"#ff4500","name":"t5_48t85","created":1510880378,"url":"/r/rareinsults/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1510880378,"banner_size":[735,220],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Did you stumble across a unique insult?
