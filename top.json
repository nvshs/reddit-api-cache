Be respectful to others - this includes no hostility, racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.\n2. Submissions must be *future focused*. All posts must have an initial comment, a **Submission Statement**, that suggests a line of future-focused discussion for the topic posted. We want this submission statement to elaborate on the topic being posted and suggest how it might be discussed in relation to the future.\n3. No memes, reaction gifs or similarly low effort content. Images/gifs require a starter comment.\n4. No spamming - this includes polls and surveys\n5. Bots require moderator permission to operate\n6. Comments must be on topic, contribute to the discussion and be of sufficient length. Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence are a distraction to discussion of futurology and may be removed.\n7. Account age: &gt;1 day to comment, &gt;5 days to submit content\n8. Submissions and comments of accounts whose combined karma is too far in the negatives will be removed\n9. Avoid posting content that is a duplicate of content posted within the last 7 days.\n10. Text posts need to encourage in-depth and detailed discussion. Avoid generalized invitations to discuss frequently discussed topics. Submissions with **[in-depth]** in the title have stricter post length and quality guidelines\n11. Titles must accurately and truthfully represent the content of the submission\n12. Support original sources - avoid blogs/websites that are primarily rehosted content\n13. Content older than 6 months must have [month, year] in the title\n&gt;\nFor details on the rules see the\n [**Rules Wiki**](/r/futurology/wiki/rules).\n\n&gt;\nFor details on moderation procedures, see the\n [**Transparency Wiki**](/r/Futurology/wiki/transparency).\n  \n&gt;\n \n#####On Futurology\n\nIf history studies our past and social sciences study our present, what is the study of our future? Future(s) Studies (colloquially called \"future(s)\" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s). \n\nOne of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur. \n\n#####Recommended Links\n\n* **[Best of

Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title.

Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned.
