Any of this disallowed content hiding within \"allowed\" content may be met with further action at moderator discretion.\n\n  Any meta posts should be posted on our special [complaint forum](https://i.imgur.com/FOKLgfe.png). Don't post them here. \n\n5. **Avoid reposts, flooding, and spam.** \n\n Use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) or [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) and check /new and the front page before you post. Unfortunately, due to recent Reddit changes, karmadecay is not as effective, so we have a pretty light hand with repost violations and are not likely to ban you if you make a mistake. \n\n Do not post more than 4 posts in a 24 hour period.  \n\n6. **Be civil: No racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.** \n\n  The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team. \n\n  Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance. \n\n  If you're a jerk, including use of \"tard\" or anything related to a racial supremacist ideology, you'll be shown the door. \n\n  If you're intentionally trolling, including \"google games,\" you will be banned. \n\n7. **Do not brigade.** \n\n  Coming to this community en masse specifically to harass our users, or setting up a post or thread here referring to another subreddit or thread causes a lot of problems for everyone. If we suspect you're doing it, you will be banned. \n\n ___7b.___  **No \"Meta\" Posts.**\n\n Meta posts about this subreddit, or posts referencing any other subreddit are not allowed due to sitewide rules and brigading problems. This includes links to, or screen-shots of any other subreddit and or any other sub's comment section.\n\n\n8. **Follow Reddit's global rules.** Submissions failing to follow [Reddit's content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) will be removed. Basically, if you are trying to sell your T-Shirts or flip flops or sexbot site, or if you're a terrorist, you're gonna be booted. \n\n9. **No pointing at offsite resources**\n\n  Due to spam and foreign disinformation campaigns that have targeted Reddit in the past (including /r/PoliticalHumor in 2015-2016), we are banning any images that reference or bear the image of Facebook groups, other watermarks, or individual websites not ranked highly on Alexa Website Rankings.\n\n  This includes screenshots of dubious news sites, watermarks, and certain social media accounts posing as something they are not. This does NOT include political cartoons, screenshots of individual Twitter posts, or established satirical websites.\n\n###Enforcement Policy \n\n\n* **Moderators will enforce the rules at their sole discretion.** \n\n* You may ask for clarification of a removal by [messaging the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor) with a link to your post or comment. \n\n* To appeal a ban, respond to your original ban message. We will politely tell you to go away if you fail to do this. \n\n\n* Users who are polite and understanding will be unbanned.  \n\n* If you want to go higher up the chain for a complaint on how we moderate our subreddit, please fill out [this form](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/)\n\n###Related Political Subreddits\n\n* /r/Politics: What do art majors think of this issue? \n\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes: What do high schoolers think of this issue?\n\n* /r/BlackPeopleTwitter: The biggest libertarian sub on Reddit\n\n* /r/WhitePeopleTwitter: Asians can post here too\n\n* /r/LatinoPeopleTwitter: They use the word \"puto\" like weeboos use the word \"baka\"\n\n* /r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter: Don't you know that Twitter subreddits are supposed to be racially segregated?\n\n* /r/CleverComebacks: AKA /r/Twitter\n\n* /r/Technology: If we nerd it up enough, we can pretend we're not political. \n\n* /r/WorldNews: Nationalist Thunderdome\n\n* /r/Europe:  Americans pay about as much attention to this as they do to Eurovision\n\n* /r/UKPolitics: r/UKPolitics: Politics, in English. \n\n* /r/Canada: A moose once bit my sister\n\n* /r/JoeBiden: You can see his teeth from a mile away but you really gotta watch for his hands\n\n* /r/Conservative: Libertarian since January 20th, 2021!\n\n* /r/Libertarian: They hate regulation so much they can't even regulate what \"libertarian\" means  \n\n* /r/libertarianmeme: I do what I want - Ron\n\n* /r/RandomActsOfMuting: Literally nothing to do with politics\n\n* /r/Socialism: Every user is also a moderator.

The show ran from 2005-2013 but is still watched just as much today. Join us as we discuss the show!\n\n\n---\n\n#####Discord Server\n\nr/DunderMifflin now has a Discord Server. [Click here to join](https://discord.gg/dundermifflin) and discuss the show!\n\n---\n#####Rules\n\n####1) Be Civil\n\nDon't ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been, ever, for any reason whatsoever. \n\n####2) No spam/Low-effort posts\n\nKeep posts directly related to TV show \"The Office\". Low effort posts will be removed, [for examples and more info, click here](https://redd.it/95w3xk). Memes/images from social media will also likely be removed as they're 99% reposts.\n\n####3) No piracy\n\nDon't link to or request episodes hosted illegally online. This includes streams, torrents, cloud-hosted files, etc.\n\n####4) No politics\n\nNo posts related to politics. They always result in uncivil discussion and aren't welcome here. This includes posts mentioning/comparing something or someone from the show to a political figure, or anything you saw at a protest/strike/rally.\n\n####5) No cake-day posts/asking for karma\n\nCake day posts are forbidden unless they are high-effort OC. \n\n####6) Image hosting\n\nImages, GIFs, and Webms to be hosted on Reddit, Imgur, gfycat, or giphy only.\n\n####7) Self-Promotion\n\nThe promotion of products or services whose sale benefits you, either directly or indirectly, is forbidden.\n\n####8) No Merchandise\nPosts that are about items of merchandise (\"look at this cool shirt\", \"I found this board game\", \"I made Cards Against The Office\") are prohibited without prior mod approval.\n\n####9) No New Spoilers\nActors from The Office may feature in new media and franchises. Though it may be tempting to discuss their new roles, feeling like this is a safe community to do so: it isn't. This subreddit is for The Office only. If you make a post or comment that spoils new content (within reason, like for a major franchise) in other \"cinematic universes\", the post will be removed, and you may receive a ban.\n\n[Learn your rules](https://i.redd.it/w9drnp65p5b11.gif)\n\n#####Guidelines:\n\n####Reposts\n\nPlease do not repost. Frequent reposts will be removed, please search the sub before posting.\n\nRecent reposts will also be removed. If you're posting a recent tweet/article/headline, it's probably already been submitted.\n\n####Stay relevant\n\nMake sure your whole post is relevant to the show, not just the title or image.
