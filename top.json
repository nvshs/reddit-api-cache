If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.\n\n* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.\n\n* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as \"My...\", \"Mine...\", \"Our...\", \"We...\", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.\n\n###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** \nPlease cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.\n\n* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**\n* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged.

General cursing/foul language are allowed.\n* The definition of what truly is \"Oddly Satisfying\" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.\n\n###9) **Crossposts**\n* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma. \n\n#####Related subreddits:\n* /r/ArtisanVideos \n\n* /r/asmr \n\n* /r/clonedgif \n\n* /r/interestingasfuck \n\n* /r/knolling \n\n* /r/loadingicon \n\n* /r/lookscool \n\n* /r/mesmerizinggifs \n\n* /r/mildlyinfuriating \n\n* /r/mildlyinteresting \n\n* r/OrganizationPorn \n\n* /r/parasnailing \n\n* /r/perfectfit \n\n* /r/perfectLoops \n\n* /r/pic \n\n* /r/powerwashingporn \n\n* /r/satisfyinggrass\n\n* /r/showerthoughts \n\n* /r/simulated \n\n* /r/slightlyunsatisfying \n\n* /r/SlyGifs   \n\n* /r/ThatPeelingFeeling\n\n* /r/ThisBlewMyMind \n\n* /r/WtWFotMJaJtRAtCaB [SFW]","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"oddlysatisfying","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6NYespd3jy62IgAehgvHjNFg8z9zBIlFefIn2ZrF5oQ.png","title":"Oddly Satisfying","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#00a6a5","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/65GJujMgAXbydbxxFPYm6eck1YffqR-anhX4-hxnVhQ.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[115,120],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9364166,"submit_text_label":"Texty-text text","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/oddlysatisfying","key_color":"#ff66ac","name":"t5_2x93b","created":1368595528,"url":"/r/oddlysatisfying/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1368595528,"banner_size":[1280,384],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"For those little things that are inexplicably satisfying.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"funny","title":"invisibility","ups":56363,"post_hint":"hosted:video","media":{"reddit_video":{"bitrate_kbps":2400,"fallback_url":"https://v.redd.it/77i5tseykjva1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback","height":720,"width":394,"scrubber_media_url":"https://v.redd.it/77i5tseykjva1/DASH_96.mp4","dash_url":"https://v.redd.it/77i5tseykjva1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1684863061%2CNDYxNGIwZWJlNDlmMWY0Mjk4YWMxNDdlN2I1MWZjMmZjYmY4MDIwZmNiNWNmZGQxMjEzYzZiMzhkOTM1NWZmZA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","duration":49,"hls_url":"https://v.redd.it/77i5tseykjva1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1684863061%2CNzkxZTkwNjJjZmFlZWY4NmQ5YjE0MGJiNmJkN2ZjNjNkNzE5MGExMjRjMzA3YjJiNGM2ZWI1MWIwZDg2ZWE4Zg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","is_gif":false,"transcoding_status":"completed"}},"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9zfV0uAe-z008QZ0NJnHQ34o30cmLCN9-qBCgAZGcc0.png","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":null,"show_media":true,"description":"**Welcome to r/Funny:**\n\n\nYou may only post if you are funny. \n\n\n**Please read [our complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules) before posting.**\n\n-----\n\n[New to Reddit?
