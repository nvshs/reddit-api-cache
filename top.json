Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

No x-posts or reposts\n&gt; Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.\n\n&gt; **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post.

This means no images of screens, pictures of screens taken with a different device, images that have been partially or fully generated by a computer, or pictures of printed out screenshots. Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n&gt; **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n&gt; **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n&gt; **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image.

Things that are entertaining (board games, video games, \"funny\" videos, etc) do not count as Entertainment News. \n\n  **Politicians** and members of the world's various **Royal Families** are not entertainers, please don't post about them here. People who were once actors but became Royals or politicians (e.g. Grace Kelly, Ronald Reagan, Meghan Markle) are excepted if the post is about their career in the entertainment industry. \n\n2. **Don't spam.** No one wants to see your YouTube video about \n\"Sexy Office Romance Stripping\" or the \"Best hair shaving prank 2018 ( gone wrong)\". Don't even think about posting your blogspam, YouTube spam, or domain spam here, thank you.\n\n3. **Abusive comments.** If there's a point you want to make please do so, but **name-calling or verbal abuse may result in a ban**. Use the report function to flag abusive comments rather than responding and escalating. \n\n4. **Trolls and brigaders** will be banned summarily.\n\n5. **Racism and hate speech** will not be allowed. Those making such comments will be banned. **Sexist language** will not be tolerated. \n\n6. **Misinformation**. Deliberately spreading or repeating misinformation will result in a ban. This includes but is not limited to  unfounded allegations about celebrities and denial of COVID‑19 safety measures.\n\n7. **Editorialized titles**. Posts with editorialized titles may be removed. \n\n---\nAlthough the **culture wars** will not be won in this subreddit, it is OK to discuss differing viewpoints. However - it is not OK to comment in a way designed to provoke those who don't share your views (see Rule 4, above). A thoughtful and articulate comment might even convince someone of your sincerity and desire to make the world a better place. Above all,  please remember to be respectful and considerate.
