No content involving people harming or harassing animals. Please do not submit sunrises, sunsets, or other content which does not have an element of 'wow-factor'. No posting of photoshopped or otherwise excessively and unnecessarily manipulated images.\n\n#####`2.` **Submission Titles**\n\n&gt; Every post title must begin with the fire emoji (🔥) and a space. The fire emoji defines this community. Your post will be automatically removed if you do not follow this rule.\n\n&gt;Titles should be accurate and descriptive: low effort titles will be removed. Include the animal/plant name, a location, and brief description to the best of your ability. Titles cannot say \"[Subject] is Lit\".\n\n#####`3.`  **Reposts**\n\n&gt;No posts that have been previously posted on this subreddit within 120 days (4 months) may be posted again. No posts that have previously been posted on this subreddit with over 10,000 upvotes in the past year may be posted again.\n\n&gt;Search the subreddit for key terms like the animal name before posting to check if your post is a repost. You can also use KarmaDecay and Google Reverse Image Search. Spamming many posts or excessive cross-posting in an attempt to karma farm will get you banned. \n\n#####`5.` **NSFW/L**  \n\n&gt;We do not allow NSFW content: bloody, gory and violent content can be redirected to our sister subreddit /r/natureismetal.\n\n\n#####`6.` **Human Concerns**  \n\n&gt; No politics, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, diet, or similar topics of human conceit. We are here for the awesomeness of nature. Any references to these topics will be removed.\n\n**REGARDING HIDDEN ACCOUNT AGE/KARMA THRESHOLD**\n\nWe hide the exact amounts to combat the rampant spam on this subreddit, this was the only way we found to significantly fight the spam/repost bot accounts. These numbers are not high and don’t take long to achieve, but the exact numbers are hidden so karma farming bots can’t just meet them easily then come here. Please do not send us a message to inquire about our karma rules. It's a question we do not and will not answer, nor do we override. Go out and build your numbers and try again in the future - we're not going anywhere :) \n\n##Please Visit Our Sister Subreddits:\n\nFor badass nature in all its gorey brutality, visit /r/natureismetal.\n\nFor cool extinct nature, check out /r/Naturewasmetal.\n\nFor people being badasses, visit /r/Humansaremetal.\n\nFor dead animals doing crazy things from the afterlife, check out /r/taxidermy and /r/taxidermyismetal.\n\n\n##[**User Flair**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/wiki/index#wiki_user_flairs)  \n##[**Subreddit Charities**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/wiki/charities)\n##[Moderator Feedback](/message/compose/?to=%2Fr%2FNatureIsFuckingLit&amp;subject=%2Fr%2FNatureIsFuckingLit%20Feedback)\n##[Moderators List](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/about/moderators)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"NatureIsFuckingLit","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tzrObEQglQISdgQA34GjDYEm1BwuX3cM32DHk4F2OeQ.png","title":"🔥 Nature Is Fucking Lit","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#ffffff","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xNPwgp0SenX_J5sXRiGKNFLUa09-RxJlBp2mG2Gq5AU.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[45,45],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9826675,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/NatureIsFuckingLit","key_color":"#ff8717","name":"t5_3gdh7","created":1474215158,"url":"/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1474215158,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"We are here to appreciate the awesome majesty and incredibly cool aspects of nature. 🔥","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"ContagiousLaughter","title":"Ready or not","ups":76219,"post_hint":"hosted:video","media":{"reddit_video":{"bitrate_kbps":2400,"fallback_url":"https://v.redd.it/ddp1830bh1pa1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback","height":720,"width":406,"scrubber_media_url":"https://v.redd.it/ddp1830bh1pa1/DASH_96.mp4","dash_url":"https://v.redd.it/ddp1830bh1pa1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1682020822%2CODgyYTVkZWIzNDM1YmNkZjQ2N2RmMjhmMDRlYTczMzRiYTZjMDhiMzk2ZjZiZmI5ZGJiN2JhMjFiMjViMmQwOA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","duration":7,"hls_url":"https://v.redd.it/ddp1830bh1pa1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1682020822%2CNzEyZTRhYmZlZmU1MjJiZDVlNzM5NzNkNTU4ZmNlZmQ3NzRiNTJlZDEwMzMzZTA1YTQwNjE0YWE2YTVlMGYwMQ%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","is_gif":false,"transcoding_status":"completed"}},"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":["giphy"],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2u2bh/styles/communityIcon_9inc3hztotg91.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=34cbe966e07792dbf7b38dbdb77d01066ecf245d","show_media":true,"description":"**Videos of people laughing infectiously.

This is a happy place. Be respectful.\n\nComments or posts not in keeping with the tone of the sub will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nBullying, racism, homophobia and sexual comments in any form, comments or links, will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nIf the comment section gets too heated, it will get locked.\n\n###2. Audible and contagious laughing\n\nAll videos must contain contagious laughter.\n\nDo not post videos that are just funny because of a joke or a situation.\n\nAudience or edited in laughter does not count as contagious laughter.\n\nCompilations are mostly old and common reposts. Please refrain from posting them here.\n\nNo bullying or victimisation. No videos of people fighting or otherwise bad natured laughs.\n\n###3. Video length\n\nVideos must be at least 10 seconds long and have a good amount of laughing in them.\n\nIf the video is more than 1 minute long, please link directly to the specific moment when it is appropriate to start watching. Alternatively include the appropriate time code in the post title.\n\n###4. No reposts\n\nReposts may be removed to encourage fresh content.\n\nRemember to check top posts and search using keywords before you post.\n\nIt's also wise to check newest posts to see if someone has just posted the same viral video you are crossposting.\n\n###5. Post must have a proper title\n\nUse a descriptive title. Bad titles are hard to search and leads to more unnecessary reposts. Mods have the final word on what is considered a bad title.\n\nExamples of bad titles: \".\", \"title\", \"😂😂\", \"funny title\", \"wait for it\", \"this made me laugh\"\n\n###6. No content promotion\n\nThis subreddit is not your personal marketing place. No spamming in general.\n\n###7. No politics\n\nPolitical videos and arguments are not allowed and will be removed. Let's keep this sub politics free.","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"ContagiousLaughter","header_img":null,"title":"Contagious Laughter","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":null,"primary_color":"","icon_img":"","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a new video","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":5933560,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/ContagiousLaughter","key_color":"#ddbd37","name":"t5_2u2bh","created":1336564914,"url":"/r/ContagiousLaughter/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1336564914,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Something to put you in a good mood.\n\nVideos of people laughing infectiously.

Don’t violate Reddit's Content Policy**\n1. Pretty simple. Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, incite violence, etc. Find the content policy [here] (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). If you disagree with this, take it up with the admins, because we have no say in them.\n\n\n###**II. Don't be a cunt**\n\n1. Also simple. If you come to this sub to be a cunt and to argue about politics, religion, etc in an uncivil way, then you will be banned. This is a shitposting sub dammit, not r/politics.\n\n\n###**III. Shitposts 😃 God awful posts 😡**\n\n1. This subreddit is for shitposts, not gawdawfulposts. and yes, repost chains/blatant karmawhoring posts are godawfulposts, not shitposts. Posting literal shit=ban. [Due to the poll addressing user complaints](https://redd.it/piumy6) the following are now being removed: unoriginal comment baiting posts (AMA, start arguing, ask questions and edit) and CUM spam. \n\n\n###**IV. Mod discretion**\n\n1. Mods have final say on what content stays or goes. Pursuant to Comb. Civ. C. §22SA{g}{i} We reserve the right to ban users for making our subreddit terrible\n\n\n###**V. Kevin**\n\n1. Kevin\n\n\n###**VI. No excessive spamming**\n\n1. Pretty easy. Don't spam posts or comments. We are a shitposting sub, but we have *some*, miniscule, standards.\n\n\n###**VII. Number 7**\n\n1. A Bangledeshi 20 year old student was arrested after watching porn, stripping naked and attacking an attendant during a flight. In March 2018, shortly after the Malindo Air flight departed from Kuala Lumpur, the 20 year old started watching pornography on his laptop. As no one seemed to notice or call him out for it, the man began taking his clothes off. At the request of the cabin crew, the student put his clothes back on. But soon, he tried to hug female flight attendants.\n\n\n###**VIII. Really, seriously, don’t be a cunt**\n\n1. That whole “don’t be a cunt” thing, just don’t\n\n\n###**IX. Properly mark NSFW and spoilers**\n\n1. im at work 😡what if my boss sees boobies on my screen 🤬. \"idk if it's nsfw/a spoiler or not\" then just mark it anyways.\n\n\n###**X. Videos must not exceed 1-ish minutes**\n\n1. This is to prevent overly long videos that become a bore to have to look at.\n\n\n^Hover ^over ^the ^rules ^to ^view ^them.\n\n---\n\n#####[Reddetiquette](https://reddit.com/wiki/reddetiquette)\n\n\n[](https://discord.gg/bvNZRuKxWk)\n---","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"shitposting","header_img":null,"title":"shitposting","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#b8001f","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gR3vPt3PqLBCCsbqGWUZIaSbYiUoLGh8wUZPyvxli1c.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"This button is called Rory.","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":true,"subscribers":2237065,"submit_text_label":"Say hello to Kevin","link_flair_position":"right","display_name_prefixed":"r/shitposting","key_color":"","name":"t5_2usxq","created":1345364538,"url":"/r/shitposting/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1345364538,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Be Funny","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"dankmemes","title":"Economic Roller Coaster","ups":53861,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/qw_Pu_7Mpd5CxMsvw9rAoy0042tmXKpsgrzL81fOM84.png","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2zmfe/styles/communityIcon_g5xoywnpe2l91.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=51f28a98785adc76dfa58f127956764d32da0a9c","show_media":true,"description":"**A Place to Post the Dankest Memes**\n\n- /r/dankmemes\n\n##/r/dankmemes\n\n**[RULES](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/about/rules/)**. |              \n:--|:--                                  \n 1: Posts must follow reddit content policy and/or reddiquette.|\n 2: No Bigotry or Bullying|\n 3: No trolling|\n 4: Censor any and all personal information from posts and comments|\n 5: No spam, outside links, or videos.

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you…\" or \"When they…\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed. Try /r/NSFWfunny. Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social media or electronic messaging content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed.

No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned.

No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.
