Don't be a dick\nIt's not hard, just be nice to each other.\n\n###2. No hateful insults\nDon't post hateful insults\n\n###3. No reposts\nDon't repost. Please refer to our [common repost album.](https://imgur.com/a/8XDVQtt)\n\n###4. Not a rare insult/threat\n/r/rareinsults is not for unfunny/common insults, this includes insults that follow the random [adjective]+[noun] formula. It is only for rare insults. No other post types are allowed\n\nCorporate insults also fall under this category. [Click here to learn more!](https://redd.it/ghj57g)\n\n###5. No personal information\nPersonal information includes full names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, and usernames\n\n###6. No politics\nPolitical submissions will be removed and posters will be permanently banned.\n\nThis includes mention of politicians, political commentators, and political movements\n\n###7. All posts require a proper title\nNo low effort titles or titles that contain the insult. Examples are \"for those sorting by new\" or \"lmao he called this dude a deformed shrimp.\"\n\nIf your post is removed for another reason and you repost, do not title your post \"reposting because it was removed.\"\n\n###8. No long videos (&gt;10s) or long texts\nDon't post long videos and don't post long texts. If the entirety of the long text is an insult, then it belongs on /r/murderedbywords, and if it is a long text with only a small insult buried inside the text, it will be removed.\n\n###9. No image macros/memes\nPosting memes or images with text on them(image macros) aren't allowed as they detract from the main point of the subreddit, which is rare insults. Memes are off-topic and belong in other subreddits.\n\n###10. No crossposts\n\n###11. No r/RoastMe\nInsults from r/RoastMe are not allowed, as people have time to sit and think of clever insults rather than coming up with them in the moment.\n\n###12. Moderators' Discretion\n\nModerators reserve the right to remove any post they deem unfit for the subreddit, even if it doesn't explicitly break any rules. This rule will only be used in specific ways, such as one/two word posts, posts in different languages, etc. This is extremely subjective and mostly up to the judgement of the mods using it, so if you disagree with this rule being used to remove your post, let us know using [modmail](/message/compose/?to=/r/rareinsults)\n\n[](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"rareinsults","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Zhwk3hcVO2qCD3oL6A6oYdskQzcwGKQUNRGa4clt4Tg.png","title":"r/RareInsults","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#7193ff","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wWCY2qH6nBLeYtLIxWMMSzNKNVAgZqoGnsBQTV4RwWs.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a rare insult","header_size":[96,96],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":2341396,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/rareinsults","key_color":"#ff4500","name":"t5_48t85","created":1510880378,"url":"/r/rareinsults/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1510880378,"banner_size":[735,220],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Did you stumble across a unique insult?
