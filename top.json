Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable.\n\n* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions in the technological world.\n\n* ####Please do not submit the following:\n\n* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.\n\n* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. \n\n* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).\n\n* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.\n\n* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).\n\n* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.\n\n* vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.\n\n* viii) Social media links/profiles/invites or promotions (eg. Facebook, Instagram, Pintrest etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. \n\n##2. Behaviour\n\n* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, trolling or bigotry in any form are therefore not allowed and will be removed. Repeated abuse can result in a permanent ban.\n\n##3. Titles\n\n* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote, which must:\n\n* adequately describe the content\n\n* adequately describe the content's relation to technology\n\n* be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning. \n\n##4. Flair\n\n* Please flair your submission appropriately. [An extended guide to flairing can be found here, in the wiki](/r/technology/wiki/flair).\n\n##5.

No content involving people harming or harassing animals. Please do not submit sunrises, sunsets, or other content which does not have an element of 'wow-factor'. No posting of photoshopped or otherwise excessively and unnecessarily manipulated images.\n\n#####`2.` **Submission Titles**\n\n&gt; Every post title must begin with the fire emoji (üî•) and a space. The fire emoji defines this community. Your post will be automatically removed if you do not follow this rule.\n\n&gt;Titles should be accurate and descriptive: low effort titles will be removed.

Titles cannot say \"[Subject] is Lit\".\n\n#####`3.`  **Reposts**\n\n&gt;No posts that have been previously posted on this subreddit within 120 days (4 months) may be posted again. No posts that have previously been posted on this subreddit with over 10,000 upvotes in the past year may be posted again.\n\n&gt;Search the subreddit for key terms like the animal name before posting to check if your post is a repost. You can also use KarmaDecay and Google Reverse Image Search. Spamming many posts or excessive cross-posting in an attempt to karma farm will get you banned. \n\n#####`5.` **NSFW/L**  \n\n&gt;We do not allow NSFW content: bloody, gory and violent content can be redirected to our sister subreddit /r/natureismetal.\n\n\n#####`6.` **Human Concerns**  \n\n&gt; No politics, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, diet, or similar topics of human conceit.

These numbers are not high and don‚Äôt take long to achieve, but the exact numbers are hidden so karma farming bots can‚Äôt just meet them easily then come here.
