All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you…\" or \"When they…\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed. Try /r/NSFWfunny. Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social media or electronic messaging content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed. This includes anything from Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, or any form of \"comments section\" on the Internet, as well as [content accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Images with SnapChat text added are allowed, as long as all UI elements have been removed.

Don’t violate Reddit's Content Policy**\n1. Pretty simple. Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, incite violence, etc. Find the content policy [here] (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). If you disagree with this, take it up with the admins, because we have no say in them.\n\n\n###**II. Don't be a cunt**\n\n1. Also simple. If you come to this sub to be a cunt and to argue about politics, religion, etc in an uncivil way, then you will be banned. This is a shitposting sub dammit, not r/politics.\n\n\n###**III. Shitposts 😃 God awful posts 😡**\n\n1. This subreddit is for shitposts, not gawdawfulposts. and yes, repost chains/blatant karmawhoring posts are godawfulposts, not shitposts. Posting literal shit=ban. [Due to the poll addressing user complaints](https://redd.it/piumy6) the following are now being removed: unoriginal comment baiting posts (AMA, start arguing, ask questions and edit) and CUM spam. \n\n\n###**IV. Mod discretion**\n\n1. Mods have final say on what content stays or goes. Pursuant to Comb. Civ. C. §22SA{g}{i} We reserve the right to ban users for making our subreddit terrible\n\n\n###**V. Kevin**\n\n1. Kevin\n\n\n###**VI. No excessive spamming**\n\n1. Pretty easy. Don't spam posts or comments. We are a shitposting sub, but we have *some*, miniscule, standards.\n\n\n###**VII. Number 7**\n\n1. A Bangledeshi 20 year old student was arrested after watching porn, stripping naked and attacking an attendant during a flight. In March 2018, shortly after the Malindo Air flight departed from Kuala Lumpur, the 20 year old started watching pornography on his laptop. As no one seemed to notice or call him out for it, the man began taking his clothes off. At the request of the cabin crew, the student put his clothes back on. But soon, he tried to hug female flight attendants.\n\n\n###**VIII. Really, seriously, don’t be a cunt**\n\n1. That whole “don’t be a cunt” thing, just don’t\n\n\n###**IX. Properly mark NSFW and spoilers**\n\n1. im at work 😡what if my boss sees boobies on my screen 🤬. \"idk if it's nsfw/a spoiler or not\" then just mark it anyways.\n\n\n###**X. Videos must not exceed 1-ish minutes**\n\n1. This is to prevent overly long videos that become a bore to have to look at.\n\n\n^Hover ^over ^the ^rules ^to ^view ^them.\n\n---\n\n#####[Reddetiquette](https://reddit.com/wiki/reddetiquette)\n\n\n[](https://discord.gg/bvNZRuKxWk)\n---","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"shitposting","header_img":null,"title":"shitposting","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#b8001f","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gR3vPt3PqLBCCsbqGWUZIaSbYiUoLGh8wUZPyvxli1c.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"This button is called Rory.","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":true,"subscribers":2229777,"submit_text_label":"Say hello to Kevin","link_flair_position":"right","display_name_prefixed":"r/shitposting","key_color":"","name":"t5_2usxq","created":1345364538,"url":"/r/shitposting/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1345364538,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Be Funny","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"TIHI","title":"Thanks, I Hate This Surprise Twist on the Nigerian Scam Meme","ups":52662,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":["giphy"],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_r1l2z/styles/communityIcon_ayqmy4r02nx31.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=80eb7b6ccfb80cfa4a08704bb60fa69a7e8c6f92","show_media":true,"description":"Thanks, I hate it.\n_____________________\n# Rules\n# 1.

This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).\n####What does \"Oddly Satisfying\" mean?\nWe are forever searching for a \"true definition\". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* \"oddly satisfying\" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.\n\n***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**\n\n######Rules:\n**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**\n###1)  **Banned Topics:**\nWe have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:\n\n* **Memes or image macros**\n\n* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as \"2048\", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.\n\n* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.\n\n* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).\n\n* **Compilation Albums/Videos**\n  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**\n  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).\n  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.\n\n* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.\n\n* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. \n\n###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** \nNSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (\"Say it, don't show it.\"). \n\n###3)  **Reposts:** \n**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.\n\n* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.\n\n* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as \"My...\", \"Mine...\", \"Our...\", \"We...\", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.\n\n###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** \nPlease cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.\n\n* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**\n* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)\n\n###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**\n\n* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: \n  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing &amp; ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.\n\n###8) **Reddiquette, Comments &amp; Subreddit Behavior:**\n\n* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.\n* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.\n* The definition of what truly is \"Oddly Satisfying\" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.\n\n###9) **Crossposts**\n* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma. \n\n#####Related subreddits:\n* /r/ArtisanVideos \n\n* /r/asmr \n\n* /r/clonedgif \n\n* /r/interestingasfuck \n\n* /r/knolling \n\n* /r/loadingicon \n\n* /r/lookscool \n\n* /r/mesmerizinggifs \n\n* /r/mildlyinfuriating \n\n* /r/mildlyinteresting \n\n* r/OrganizationPorn \n\n* /r/parasnailing \n\n* /r/perfectfit \n\n* /r/perfectLoops \n\n* /r/pic \n\n* /r/powerwashingporn \n\n* /r/satisfyinggrass\n\n* /r/showerthoughts \n\n* /r/simulated \n\n* /r/slightlyunsatisfying \n\n* /r/SlyGifs   \n\n* /r/ThatPeelingFeeling\n\n* /r/ThisBlewMyMind \n\n* /r/WtWFotMJaJtRAtCaB [SFW]","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"oddlysatisfying","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6NYespd3jy62IgAehgvHjNFg8z9zBIlFefIn2ZrF5oQ.png","title":"Oddly Satisfying","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#00a6a5","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/65GJujMgAXbydbxxFPYm6eck1YffqR-anhX4-hxnVhQ.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[115,120],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9151467,"submit_text_label":"Texty-text text","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/oddlysatisfying","key_color":"#ff66ac","name":"t5_2x93b","created":1368595528,"url":"/r/oddlysatisfying/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1368595528,"banner_size":[1280,384],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"For those little things that are inexplicably satisfying.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"todayilearned","title":"TIL that Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry has bred nearly 8,000 chicks annually (around 20 a day) as part of a Chicken Hatchery exhibit since 1956.

Artists are encouraged to post their own work.  News and media for adaptations based on comic books are welcome. Read [the subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/wiki/index) for more information about the subreddit.\n\n\n##[General Conduct](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_general_conduct)\n\n&gt; 1. **[Don't complain about comics you don't like or understand.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_1._don.27t_complain_about_comics_you_don.27t_like.)** - If you don't get a comic, it's probably not meant for you. Comics are often targeted at certain audiences. If you don't get a comic, odds are it wasn't meant for you. Don't whine about it; just move on to the next comic.\n2. **[Don't attack artists posting their content.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_2._don.27t_attack_artists_posting_their_content)** - It's not ok to attack artists with hateful comments meant to tear them down or try to chase them off Reddit. \n3. **[Don't make drama for drama's sake. No trolling.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_3._don.27t_make_drama_for_drama.27s_sake._no_trolling.)** - Anyone wanting to participate in this community needs to keep their comments civil.  No hateful comments or posts - Any comments or posts that are racist, mysogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, misinformation or extremist in nature will be removed and will result in an immediate ban.\n4. **[Respect the [OC] System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_4._respect_the_.5Boc.5D_system)** - The [OC] tag is for artists wanting to submit their Original Content.  False claims on others' art will get you banned.\n5. **[Respect the Report System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_5._respect_the_report_system)** - Reports are for content that breaks this sub's/Reddit's rules.  False reports are given to the Reddit Admins. \n6. **[Tag NSFW content when needed.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_6._tag_nsfw_content_when_needed.)** - Content with nudity, pornography, or obvious profanity should be tagged as NSFW.  \n\n##[What is OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_ok_to_post)\n\n&gt; * **Comic covers or short excerpts** - *A few* scanned pages can be posted for discussion.  Don't post entire comic books.  Posts with too many pages will get removed.\n* **Web comic strips** - Most strips need to be linked back to original sources (i.e. the artists' websites).   Don't link to [rehosted](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_rehosting) or [hotlinked](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_hotlinking) comics. Artists can use [OC] to link to their own work anywhere.\n* **Links to articles, videos, art, cosplay or music** - Content directly related to comic books or web comics, including film and TV media.  \n* **Discussion topics** - Talk about past or present comic books or strips.  Topics about comic-based movies or TV shows are also fine.\n* **Translations** - English translations of non-English original comics are ok as long as the translation is honest and a link to the original source is provided in a comment.\n\n##[What is not OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_not_ok_to_post)\n\n&gt; * **Edits to comics that you didn't make** - Don't remove watermarks/attribution or try to \"fix\" someone else's work.  Post your own original content.\n* **Stuff that just reminds you of comics without there being any real reference in the topic** - Please keep posts on topic with real comic content.\n* **Links to download complete, pirated comic books** - Please support comics by buying them.\n\n\n##[Are You A Comic Artist?](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_are_you_a_comic_artist.3F)\n\n&gt; Content creators can get Artist Flair to display next to their account names on all of their posts. [Message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FComics) with some proof and the name of your strip for some blue flair.  Artists without flair can add [OC] to post titles to identify their \"Original Content.\" Tagging a post with [OC] allows links to general hosting sites like Imgur.\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp;\n    \n&gt; [ ](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23comics \"flair-talk\")\n\n##Related Subreddits\n\n&gt; * /r/comicbooks\n* /r/webcomics\n* /r/manga\n* /r/graphicnovels\n* /r/comicbookart\n* /r/comiccon\n* /r/comic_crits\n* /r/wholesomecomics \n* /r/webtoons \n* /r/comicbookshelves.\n* [Marvel Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/marvel)\n* [DC Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/dc)\n* [Image Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/image)\n* [Vertigo Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/vertigo)\n* [Dark Horse Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/darkhorse)\n* [Valiant Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/valiant)\n* [Manga Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/manga)\n* [Other Comics-Related Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/other)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"comics","header_img":"https://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/uIbyX8MSVa0J6mKV.png","title":"Print Comics and Webcomics ","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":null,"primary_color":"","icon_img":"","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[175,40],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":2125967,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/comics","key_color":"#0079d3","name":"t5_2qh0s","created":1201219852,"url":"/r/comics/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1201219852,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Everything related to print comics (comic books, graphic novels, and strips) and web comics.

Hover below for more info, and check out our [wiki page](/r/mildlyinteresting/wiki)!**\n\n-----\n&gt; ### 1. No memes \n&gt; This includes references in titles of your post (e.g. \"banana for scale,\" \"potato quality\").\n\n----- \n\n&gt; ### 2. No related posts\n&gt; Posts that acknowledge, \"one-up,\" or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. \"I see your X and raise you Y\")\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###3. No x-posts or reposts\n&gt; Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.\n\n&gt; **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post. Posts deleted or removed from other subreddits are not exempt from rule 3. \n\n----- \n\n&gt; ###4. Original [OC] photographs only\n&gt; **a.** No gifs, videos, or websites.  \n\n&gt; **b.** All submissions must be original content. If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.  \n\n&gt; **c.** Software glitches/errors, overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed, although you may censor personal information per Reddit-wide rules.\n\n&gt; **d.** Side by side images are okay if they adhere to the rest of the rules.\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###5. No screenshots\n\n&gt; No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab. This means no images of screens, pictures of screens taken with a different device, images that have been partially or fully generated by a computer, or pictures of printed out screenshots. Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n&gt; **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n&gt; **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n&gt; **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image.
