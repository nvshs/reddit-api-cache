Hover below for more info, and check out our [wiki page](/r/mildlyinteresting/wiki)!**\n\n-----\n&gt; ### 1.

No related posts\n&gt; Posts that acknowledge, \"one-up,\" or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. \"I see your X and raise you Y\")\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###3. No x-posts or reposts\n&gt; Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.\n\n&gt; **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post. Posts deleted or removed from other subreddits are not exempt from rule 3. \n\n----- \n\n&gt; ###4. Original [OC] photographs only\n&gt; **a.** No gifs, videos, or websites.  \n\n&gt; **b.** All submissions must be original content. If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.  \n\n&gt; **c.** Software glitches/errors, overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed, although you may censor personal information per Reddit-wide rules.\n\n&gt; **d.** Side by side images are okay if they adhere to the rest of the rules.\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###5. No screenshots\n\n&gt; No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab. This means no images of screens, pictures of screens taken with a different device, images that have been partially or fully generated by a computer, or pictures of printed out screenshots. Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n&gt; **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n&gt; **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n&gt; **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image. (e.g. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), ;P, 😜, ❤, ★, ✿ )\n\n&gt; *Still confused?

The worst of the worst, people who you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy.\n\n##**Rules:**\n\n1. **No personal information.** Take a screenshot and completely **redact all information that can be used to identify a person**. This includes, but is not limited to: **first and last names, usernames (including your own, including the symbol which identifies a commenter as you, including any other people featured in the image, including public accounts), subreddit and online community names, titles of specific posts, and other information like addresses, phone numbers, profile pictures, and license plates.**  If you intentionally post personal information, you will be banned. This is to prevent brigading and harassment, so we take this rule very seriously.  **Do not post reddit screenshots.**\n**Do not ask for personal information, suggest someone should be doxxed, link to or comment with personal information, openly solicit personal information, or contact the people featured here. Don't even wax poetic about wanting to post identifying information. You will be banned. There are no exceptions to rule 1.**\n2. **Do not encourage, glorify, or incite violence.**  \nFor example: \"Kill yourself\", \"It wouldn't be so bad if we killed all the pedophiles\", \"This guy needs to die\", \"I hope this guy gets stabbed to death with a rusty screwdriver\", etc. Don't even joke about it, as \"I was kidding\" will not be taken as an excuse.\n\n3. **Must be a total piece of shit**  \nA total piece of shit is someone who is intentionally harming people or animals. Bad parking, annoying but harmless things, memes &amp; image macros, trophy hunters, people who put down their pets humanely, short &amp; unoriginal comments, overly political/partisan posts, screenshots of someone's Reddit profile, petty arguments, fights/simple revenge, and common/unoriginal crimes do not belong here. Anti-vaxxer posts rarely belong here.  \nIf your post isn't shitty enough, it'll be removed. It is very rare for anything featured on reddit, comment or post, to be shitty enough to be featured here. Do not post reddit screenshots.  \n**If you post a picture with the backstory in the title or comments, no story in the image, or just the face of a public figure, you will be banned.  This isn't punchablefaces.**\n\n4. **Avoid reposting**.  If you see a repost, report it, preferably with a link to the previous post.  \n\n5. **No news articles. Images, screenshots &amp; gifs only.** Reddit's native hosting and https://imgur.com/upload are preferred.  Please take a screenshot of the article, preferably the title plus a paragraph or two, or link the video through imgur or v.redd.it.  **Screenshots of the headline only will be removed.**  This is because no one reads articles, even in article subreddits; articles rarely get more than 50 upvotes here, and articles inherently include personal info for somebody, which is not allowed in any form about any person.  \n\n6. **No posts featuring gore, animal or child abuse.** Posts featuring gore/child/animal abuse are not allowed here.\n\n7. **No screenshots of subreddits, reddit profiles, reddit posts, reddit comments, or reddit direct messages.** Not even if you hide usernames. If you submit anything related to something happening on reddit you will be banned. This is to prevent harassment. Don't bring your reddit drama here. \n\n8.  **No racism/hate speech/bigotry/idiotic race baiting**  No racism, homophobia, transphobia, or other bigotry. If they're a piece of shit, you don't need to bring their whole demographic into it.\n\n---\n\n**Do not report users through modmail**, use the report button with a custom reason.  The only exception is for reporting people who are actually doxxing or other immediate threats.  Do not report people for being mean to you, arguing, or making comments which you disagree with.  If you abuse the report button or modmail, you will be banned.  **If you ask for someone who follows the rules to be banned, you may be banned.**\n\nPosts with bad titles will be automatically removed, you can then resubmit with a better title.  No, you cannot edit your post title or image once it's been created, and neither can the mods.\n\nCheck out these other subreddits:\n\n- /r/rage\n\n- /r/CasualChildAbuse\n\n- /r/MorbidReality\n\n- /r/Trashy\n\n- /r/PublicFreakout\n\n- /r/InsanePeopleFacebook\n\n---\n\n**CSS by /u/mandjob**","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"iamatotalpieceofshit","header_img":null,"title":"People who actively act like a piece of shit","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"","icon_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/BVWD9r3V0gcd-qc345bpnipcdeyl47vAuf0IQWZ1Os0.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":2035026,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/iamatotalpieceofshit","key_color":"#545452","name":"t5_3jj03","created":1489523861,"url":"/r/iamatotalpieceofshit/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1489523861,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"A place to post screenshots or gifs of people acting like a piece of shit.

Do not resort to name calling, or use condescending or patronizing language.  Racism, sexism or bigotry will not be tolerated.  Making inappropriate jokes with sexist or racist undertones is strictly prohibited. Violation of this rule may result in a ban\n\n2. **Posts must depict humans actually being bros.** Please do not post humans engaging in normal human behavior which might simply appeal to humans.\n\n3. **No reliance on additional context.**  The 'bro' action should be easily discernible within the image/gif/video. Having to add context in the title, comments, super-imposed text or otherwise to explain the 'bro' is against sub rules.  Submissions violating this rule will be removed\n\n4. **No reposts.** All reposts are removed at moderators discretion.  Repost farming is not allowed and will result in a ban.  Check the sub prior to posting to see if your submission has already been posted\n\n5.  **NSFW content.** NSFW content is sometimes okay here, but it must be flagged appropriately.  We do not allow any content related to suicide, or suicide prevention.  No rage bait submissions.  Any content that is sexually suggestive or contains drug use is grounds for a permanent ban\n\n6. **No Spam.** Original content and crossposts from other subreddits are welcome, but we do not allow posts promoting a specific website, YouTube channel, blog, subreddit etc. Such posts will be removed, reported as spam, and you will be banned.\n\n7. **No staged submissions.** Scenes set up to look helpful are staged and will be removed.  Staged videos made by content creators for clout on TikTok, YouTube or Instagram will also be removed at moderators discretion.  No poverty porn or exploitative media.  We do not allow skits or social experiment videos.\n\n8. **No memes, comics, or compilations.** Refrain from posting jokes, memes, puns, reaction gifs and wordplays. No compilation videos, gifs, pictures, etc.\n\n9. **No Fundraising/Request/Donation Posts.** This includes any post or comment asking for people to perform a 'bro' action. Examples include: attending funerals, mailing cards, petitions, joining livestreams, and GoFundMe campaigns. Moderators will ban those violating this rule.\n\n10. **No spreading misinformation.** Sharing a source and debating that source or topic in a fair and reasonable manner (i.e., without personal attacks) is encouraged. Do not make wildly unsubstantiated and/or outlandish claims without the ability to share a source.\n\n11. **No posts or comments directly about politics and no bringing politics into a post or comment not about politics.  No war related content.  No posts centered around police**\n\n12.  **No text only submissions.** This includes screenshots of text messages, twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Reddit screenshots from other communities will be reviewed on a case by case basis.  Images of text are prohibited.  This includes:  cards, letters, notes. Do not post links to Reddit posts from other communities\n\n13. **No slurs, harassing or trolling comments.  No racial slurs or sexually inappropriate comments. No hate speech.** This includes comments implying the animal in the image/gif is food, or will be eaten. Jokes about animals being food are not welcome.\nDo not post comments with a personal agenda or in an attempt to derail the thread or harass or troll other users.\n **Users violating this rule will be faced with a temporary or permanent ban**\n\n\n14.  **Comments that do not contribute to the discussion will be removed, and may face a temporary or permanent ban.

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you…\" or \"When they…\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed. Try /r/NSFWfunny. Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social media or electronic messaging content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed. This includes anything from Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, or any form of \"comments section\" on the Internet, as well as [content accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Images with SnapChat text added are allowed, as long as all UI elements have been removed.
