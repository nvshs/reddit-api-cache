Do not alter headlines; copy and paste. | The title of all submissions needs to match the article headline exactly.  **Copy and paste** from the main headline only, do not include anything beyond the primary headline such as byliners, subtitles, flavor text, quotes from the article, news outlet, location, cross post tags, (video) tags, and so on.  Do not use the “suggest title” option for posting as it often does not match the headline.  As a matter of fairness, any submission with an altered title will be removed.  The **only exception** is that, if an article has a title in **all caps**, you may change the capitalization to title case, but everything else must remain the same.|\n|2. Submit only if “Oniony”. | Please consider submitting your article to /r/OffBeat or similar subreddits unless it truly reads like The Onion wrote it. The title and article itself must both be \"Oniony\". This can be highly subjective; you are encouraged to upvote articles that should be here and downvote those that should not.  Moderators can also remove posts at their own discretion under this rule.  [More here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/done_to_death)|\n|3. Must be a news article. | Submissions must be in the form of a news article.  Videos are only allowed if they are accompanied by a complete text article.  Editorials, blogs, twitter posts, image galleries, tabloid stories, youtube videos, meta posts, static images, articles with fewer than 5 sentences, and so forth will be removed.|\n|4. Use original, reliable sources. | Find the source of your story before you submit it, simply by checking for references or googling the subject to locate the original piece.  Websites that frequently re-host viral news stories or contain misleading information are on [automatic removal](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval).  Blogs are not reliable sources.|\n|5. Do not repost similar articles. | Check the sub for your story before you submit it; if it’s already here then please vote and comment there instead of posting another version.  Similar stories will be removed and frequent re-posters will lose their posting privileges.  Do not delete and repost your own submissions without approval.|\n|6. No satire articles. | Even if they are technically from a source other than _The Onion_, any article submission written as satire or even true stories written in a satirical manner are not allowed.  Please note that some major news outlets have satirical sections, such as the Borowitz Report on the New Yorker, which are also not allowed.  Meanwhile, AVClub, while owned by The Onion, is not satire and is allowed. If you'd like, you can use a tool like http://realorsatire.com/ to see if your submission is from a known satirical website.|\n|7. No tabloid journalism. | Do not post tabloid news stories, or articles that source from tabloid news outlets (TheSun, Mirror, Dailymail, People, TMZ, etc).|\n|8. No old news. | Articles need to have been written within two weeks of its submission date.|\n|9. English articles only. | Please do not post non-English articles.  Do not use google translate for submission either; rather try to find an English version of the story by a secondary source.|\n|10. No mobile versions. | If you’re using a mobile device to post a story make sure you remove any mobile identifiers (typically “.m” or “mobile”) from the url before submitting.|\n|11. No blocked or redirected links. | Please ensure you aren’t submitting a link that utilizes a paywall or survey wall (nytimes.com, thetimes.co.uk) in order gain access to the complete article.  Do not submit links that redirect you to another site to read the article and do not submit using link shorteners either.|\n\n[](/sunburstnervous) **[Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/autoremoval) to view a list of sites deemed unreliable by our moderator team.**\n\n###See [our FAQ page](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/wiki/nto101) for more information on our rules. \n____\n\n###Keep all comments civil.\n\n[](/twirage) Personal attacks, racism, bigotry, homophobia, grandstanding, misinformation, conspiracy theories, etc. will not be tolerated and ***you will be banned***.\n\n[Witch hunting or brigading is not allowed.

Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration.

No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed.

This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.\n\nSaturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)\n\n##Rules:\n\n1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11. Submissions must fit the purpose of the community. /r/PublicFreakout is a subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public.\n\n[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.\n](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)\n\n##Tags:\n\n**[Mod's Choice]** - The mark of a good find and a quality freakout\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:Top**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=all)\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:New**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all)\n\nUsers who submit a \"Mod's Choice\" qualify for permanent custom user flair.

This includes build help, tech support, and any kind of doubt one might have about PC ownership.\r\n* You don't necessarily need a PC to be a member of the PCMR. You just have to love PCs. It's not about the hardware in your rig, but [the software in your heart!](//twitter.com/PedroPCMR/status/570009579637092352)\r\n* This is not a satirical or 'circlejerk subreddit'. [Nor did it start as one](//pcmasterrace.org/history). This is a [normal subreddit with occasional tongue-in-cheek humor elements](//pcmasterrace.org/community). We are a community where many of its members share similar opinions about the main topics, and sometimes end up having private jokes amongst ourselves.  We are not a community where members feign stupidity when posting and commenting because they find it funny. You can be banned if you conduct yourself like that here.\r\n* Owning a console does not necessarily make you a ['peasant'](//pcmasterrace.org/consolepeasants).\r\n* We created Reddit's most popular [Wiki](/r/pcmasterrace/w/).\r\n* If needed, you can [message the team behind PCMR](//reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/pcmasterrace).\r\n\r\n---\r\n#[Rules](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules)\r\n\r\nFor an in-depth explanation of our rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules).\r\n\r\n* [**Rule #1**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.231) Harassment of others is strictly forbidden.

All are welcome in the PC Master Race.

When doing giveaways please keep it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but don't mandate subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don't make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.\r\n* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to be external and/or to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).\r\n* Even if you do a giveaway, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere without prior mod approval.\r\n* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.\r\n* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner's location is allowed).\r\n* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways. If you start it, someone must win it. You cannot delete your giveaway once you post it.\r\n* Giveaways shouldn't last an absurd amount of time, nor should they be absurdly difficult to enter or win.\r\n* Do not choose your giveaway winners based on the number of upvotes or downvotes they get.\r\n* Giveaways to benefit registered charities must be verified by moderators. All other requests for donations (monetary or otherwise) are not allowed as per rule #8.\r\n* Only one entry per user to any giveaway unless otherwise stated by the giveaway poster.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck the PCMR communities elsewhere:\r\n\r\n[Twitter](//rebrand.ly/pcmrtwitter)\r\n\r\n[Facebook Page](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfaceboo)\r\n\r\n[Facebook Group](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfbgroup)\r\n\r\n[YouTube](//rebrand.ly/pcmryoutube)\r\n\r\n[Steam Group](/rebrand.ly/pcmrsteam)\r\n\r\n[Steam Curator](//rebrand.ly/pcmrcurator)\r\n\r\n[Instagram](//rebrand.ly/pcmrinstagram)\r\n\r\n[Twitch](//rebrand.ly/pcmrtwitch)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nChats:\r\n\r\n[Discord](//rebrand.ly/pcmrdiscord)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCharity: \r\n\r\n[F@H](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfold)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### [](#social)\r\n\r\n&gt; * [Website](//rebrand.ly/pcmr \"Website\")\r\n&gt; * [Twitter](//rebrand.ly/pcmrtwitter \"Twitter\")\r\n&gt; * [Discord](//rebrand.ly/pcmrdiscord \"Discord\")\r\n&gt; * [Instagram](//rebrand.ly/pcmrinstagram \"Instagram\")\r\n&gt; * [YouTube](//rebrand.ly/pcmryoutube \"YouTube\")\r\n&gt; * [Page](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfacebook \"Facebook\")\r\n&gt; * [Group](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfbgroup \"Facebook\")\r\n&gt; * [Group](//rebrand.ly/pcmrsteam \"Steam\")\r\n&gt; * [Curator](//rebrand.ly/pcmrcurator \"Steam\")\r\n\r\n[](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"pcmasterrace","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_87YiajqYLK6ZC4Qaby2raibpx1cymdx5bP1PWwlDLo.png","title":"PC Master Race - PCMR: A place where all enthusiasts of PC, PC gaming and PC technology are welcome!","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#ffcd00","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PN7Sv1axRx971W5-d_e-IC_RMiP2Sso8IqdRGq3UY9Y.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a glorious link","header_size":[800,800],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":7378176,"submit_text_label":"Submit a glorious text post","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/pcmasterrace","key_color":"#ff8717","name":"t5_2sgp1","created":1304179207,"url":"/r/pcmasterrace/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1304179207,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Welcome to the official subreddit of the PC Master Race / PCMR!\n\nAll PC related content is welcome, including build help, tech support, and any doubt one might have about PC ownership.\n\nYou don't necessarily need a PC to be a member of the PCMR.

Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles.

No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned.

Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned.
