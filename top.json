Be respectful to others - this includes no hostility, racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.\n2. Submissions must be *future focused*. All posts must have an initial comment, a **Submission Statement**, that suggests a line of future-focused discussion for the topic posted. We want this submission statement to elaborate on the topic being posted and suggest how it might be discussed in relation to the future.\n3. No memes, reaction gifs or similarly low effort content. Images/gifs require a starter comment.\n4. No spamming - this includes polls and surveys\n5. Bots require moderator permission to operate\n6. Comments must be on topic, contribute to the discussion and be of sufficient length. Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence are a distraction to discussion of futurology and may be removed.\n7. Account age: &gt;1 day to comment, &gt;5 days to submit content\n8. Submissions and comments of accounts whose combined karma is too far in the negatives will be removed\n9. Avoid posting content that is a duplicate of content posted within the last 7 days.\n10. Text posts need to encourage in-depth and detailed discussion. Avoid generalized invitations to discuss frequently discussed topics. Submissions with **[in-depth]** in the title have stricter post length and quality guidelines\n11. Titles must accurately and truthfully represent the content of the submission\n12. Support original sources - avoid blogs/websites that are primarily rehosted content\n13. Content older than 6 months must have [month, year] in the title\n&gt;\nFor details on the rules see the\n [**Rules Wiki**](/r/futurology/wiki/rules).\n\n&gt;\nFor details on moderation procedures, see the\n [**Transparency Wiki**](/r/Futurology/wiki/transparency).\n  \n&gt;\n \n#####On Futurology\n\nIf history studies our past and social sciences study our present, what is the study of our future? Future(s) Studies (colloquially called \"future(s)\" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s). \n\nOne of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur. \n\n#####Recommended Links\n\n* **[Best of

No memes \n&gt; This includes references in titles of your post (e.g. \"banana for scale,\" \"potato quality\").\n\n----- \n\n&gt; ### 2. No related posts\n&gt; Posts that acknowledge, \"one-up,\" or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. \"I see your X and raise you Y\")\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###3. No x-posts or reposts\n&gt; Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.\n\n&gt; **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post. Posts deleted or removed from other subreddits are not exempt from rule 3. \n\n----- \n\n&gt; ###4. Original [OC] photographs only\n&gt; **a.** No gifs, videos, or websites.  \n\n&gt; **b.** All submissions must be original content. If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.  \n\n&gt; **c.** Software glitches/errors, overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed, although you may censor personal information per Reddit-wide rules.\n\n&gt; **d.** Side by side images are okay if they adhere to the rest of the rules.\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###5. No screenshots\n\n&gt; No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab. This means no images of screens, pictures of screens taken with a different device, images that have been partially or fully generated by a computer, or pictures of printed out screenshots. Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n&gt; **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n&gt; **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n&gt; **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image.

No content involving people harming or harassing animals. Please do not submit sunrises, sunsets, or other content which does not have an element of 'wow-factor'. No posting of photoshopped or otherwise excessively and unnecessarily manipulated images.\n\n#####`2.` **Submission Titles**\n\n&gt; Every post title must begin with the fire emoji (🔥) and a space. The fire emoji defines this community. Your post will be automatically removed if you do not follow this rule.\n\n&gt;Titles should be accurate and descriptive: low effort titles will be removed. Include the animal/plant name, a location, and brief description to the best of your ability. Titles cannot say \"[Subject] is Lit\".\n\n#####`3.`  **Reposts**\n\n&gt;No posts that have been previously posted on this subreddit within 120 days (4 months) may be posted again. No posts that have previously been posted on this subreddit with over 10,000 upvotes in the past year may be posted again.\n\n&gt;Search the subreddit for key terms like the animal name before posting to check if your post is a repost. You can also use KarmaDecay and Google Reverse Image Search. Spamming many posts or excessive cross-posting in an attempt to karma farm will get you banned. \n\n#####`5.` **NSFW/L**  \n\n&gt;We do not allow NSFW content: bloody, gory and violent content can be redirected to our sister subreddit /r/natureismetal.\n\n\n#####`6.` **Human Concerns**  \n\n&gt; No politics, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, diet, or similar topics of human conceit. We are here for the awesomeness of nature. Any references to these topics will be removed.\n\n**REGARDING HIDDEN ACCOUNT AGE/KARMA THRESHOLD**\n\nWe hide the exact amounts to combat the rampant spam on this subreddit, this was the only way we found to significantly fight the spam/repost bot accounts. These numbers are not high and don’t take long to achieve, but the exact numbers are hidden so karma farming bots can’t just meet them easily then come here. Please do not send us a message to inquire about our karma rules. It's a question we do not and will not answer, nor do we override. Go out and build your numbers and try again in the future - we're not going anywhere :) \n\n##Please Visit Our Sister Subreddits:\n\nFor badass nature in all its gorey brutality, visit /r/natureismetal.\n\nFor cool extinct nature, check out /r/Naturewasmetal.\n\nFor people being badasses, visit /r/Humansaremetal.\n\nFor dead animals doing crazy things from the afterlife, check out /r/taxidermy and /r/taxidermyismetal.\n\n\n##[**User Flair**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/wiki/index#wiki_user_flairs)  \n##[**Subreddit Charities**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/wiki/charities)\n##[Moderator Feedback](/message/compose/?to=%2Fr%2FNatureIsFuckingLit&amp;subject=%2Fr%2FNatureIsFuckingLit%20Feedback)\n##[Moderators List](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/about/moderators)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"NatureIsFuckingLit","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tzrObEQglQISdgQA34GjDYEm1BwuX3cM32DHk4F2OeQ.png","title":"🔥 Nature Is Fucking Lit","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#ffffff","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xNPwgp0SenX_J5sXRiGKNFLUa09-RxJlBp2mG2Gq5AU.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[45,45],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9743918,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/NatureIsFuckingLit","key_color":"#ff8717","name":"t5_3gdh7","created":1474215158,"url":"/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1474215158,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"We are here to appreciate the awesome majesty and incredibly cool aspects of nature. 🔥","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"gifs","title":"Many historians believe the origin of the modern military salute can be traced to medieval knights lifting their visors to acknowledge allies","ups":44473,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":false,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2qt55/styles/communityIcon_n3wnthi7sy331.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9f1a9142b3f6492cfc373d6eca95af426e41f837","show_media":true,"description":"Links to amusing, interesting, or funny GIFs from the web! **.gif, .gifv, .ogg, .mp4, and .webm format submissions only, please!**\n\n**GIF links cannot contain sound**\n\n**If there is a violation of the rules, *please* click the report button and leave a report, and also [message the moderator team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgifs) and report the problem.**\n\n\n1. **Reposts and Crossposts:**\n * Do not post GIFs that have already appeared on /r/GIFs .
