Don’t violate Reddit's Content Policy**\n1. Pretty simple. Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, incite violence, etc. Find the content policy [here] (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). If you disagree with this, take it up with the admins, because we have no say in them.\n\n\n###**II. Don't be a cunt**\n\n1. Also simple. If you come to this sub to be a cunt and to argue about politics, religion, etc in an uncivil way, then you will be banned. This is a shitposting sub dammit, not r/politics.\n\n\n###**III. Shitposts 😃 God awful posts 😡**\n\n1. This subreddit is for shitposts, not gawdawfulposts. and yes, repost chains/blatant karmawhoring posts are godawfulposts, not shitposts. Posting literal shit=ban. [Due to the poll addressing user complaints](https://redd.it/piumy6) the following are now being removed: unoriginal comment baiting posts (AMA, start arguing, ask questions and edit) and CUM spam. \n\n\n###**IV. Mod discretion**\n\n1. Mods have final say on what content stays or goes. Pursuant to Comb. Civ. C. §22SA{g}{i} We reserve the right to ban users for making our subreddit terrible\n\n\n###**V. Kevin**\n\n1. Kevin\n\n\n###**VI. No excessive spamming**\n\n1. Pretty easy. Don't spam posts or comments. We are a shitposting sub, but we have *some*, miniscule, standards.\n\n\n###**VII. Number 7**\n\n1. A Bangledeshi 20 year old student was arrested after watching porn, stripping naked and attacking an attendant during a flight. In March 2018, shortly after the Malindo Air flight departed from Kuala Lumpur, the 20 year old started watching pornography on his laptop. As no one seemed to notice or call him out for it, the man began taking his clothes off. At the request of the cabin crew, the student put his clothes back on. But soon, he tried to hug female flight attendants.\n\n\n###**VIII. Really, seriously, don’t be a cunt**\n\n1. That whole “don’t be a cunt” thing, just don’t\n\n\n###**IX. Properly mark NSFW and spoilers**\n\n1. im at work 😡what if my boss sees boobies on my screen 🤬. \"idk if it's nsfw/a spoiler or not\" then just mark it anyways.\n\n\n###**X. Videos must not exceed 1-ish minutes**\n\n1. This is to prevent overly long videos that become a bore to have to look at.\n\n\n^Hover ^over ^the ^rules ^to ^view ^them.\n\n---\n\n#####[Reddetiquette](https://reddit.com/wiki/reddetiquette)\n\n\n[](https://discord.gg/bvNZRuKxWk)\n---","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"shitposting","header_img":null,"title":"shitposting","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#b8001f","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gR3vPt3PqLBCCsbqGWUZIaSbYiUoLGh8wUZPyvxli1c.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"This button is called Rory.","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":true,"subscribers":2229466,"submit_text_label":"Say hello to Kevin","link_flair_position":"right","display_name_prefixed":"r/shitposting","key_color":"","name":"t5_2usxq","created":1345364538,"url":"/r/shitposting/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1345364538,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Be Funny","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"marvelmemes","title":"\"Spider-Man three!!\" 🤷🏻‍♀️ -Aunt May","ups":47692,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/x2WLhJBmuEEBnLnuh41tCjNsXQVF4b3c8InNLyUGpik.png","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_35mye/styles/communityIcon_81az6pkp72da1.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3f37e086ee1b7ec2d5bc327888841977d13e7e01","show_media":true,"description":"&gt;\n\nWelcome to r/marvelmemes: A place to post the best Marvel related memes.\n\n- [Message the mods](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmarvelmemes)\n\n&gt;\n\n##Friends of r/marvelmemes:\n- [r/Marvel](http://old.reddit.com/r/Marvel)\n- [r/marvelstudios](http://old.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios)\n- [r/SpideyMeme](http://old.reddit.com/r/SpideyMeme/)\n- [r/lotrmemes](https://old.reddit.com/r/lotrmemes/)\n\n&gt; \n\n##r/marvelmemes Rules\n- Follow Reddit [rules](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette) and [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelmemes/wiki/rules#wiki_guidelines)\n- All posts must relate to Marvel\n- All posts must be Memes\n- No Reposts\n- No harassing, no threatening, no bullying\n- Do **not** post spoilers\n- No NSFW/NSFL Content\n- No Politics\n- No Illegal Content\n\n&gt;\n\n##Meme Templates\n - [Infinity War] (https://imgur.com/a/Hj3yXwe)\n - [Endgame] (https://imgur.com/a/TFPDHIX)\n - [We're all on the same team here] (https://imgur.com/jv8JWwQ)\n\n&gt;\n\nr/marvelmemes is pro-CSS\n[](#proCSS)\n\nWe support custom code and creativity on Reddit.

This helps us remove them more promptly.**\n###1)  **Banned Topics:**\nWe have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:\n\n* **Memes or image macros**\n\n* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers.

Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.\n\n* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed.

Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.\n\n* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. \n\n###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** \nNSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed.

Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.\n\n* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.\n\n* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as \"My...\", \"Mine...\", \"Our...\", \"We...\", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.\n\n###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** \nPlease cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.\n\n* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**\n* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7.

Such violations include: \n  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing &amp; ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity.

General cursing/foul language are allowed.\n* The definition of what truly is \"Oddly Satisfying\" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.\n\n###9) **Crossposts**\n* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma. \n\n#####Related subreddits:\n* /r/ArtisanVideos \n\n* /r/asmr \n\n* /r/clonedgif \n\n* /r/interestingasfuck \n\n* /r/knolling \n\n* /r/loadingicon \n\n* /r/lookscool \n\n* /r/mesmerizinggifs \n\n* /r/mildlyinfuriating \n\n* /r/mildlyinteresting \n\n* r/OrganizationPorn \n\n* /r/parasnailing \n\n* /r/perfectfit \n\n* /r/perfectLoops \n\n* /r/pic \n\n* /r/powerwashingporn \n\n* /r/satisfyinggrass\n\n* /r/showerthoughts \n\n* /r/simulated \n\n* /r/slightlyunsatisfying \n\n* /r/SlyGifs   \n\n* /r/ThatPeelingFeeling\n\n* /r/ThisBlewMyMind \n\n* /r/WtWFotMJaJtRAtCaB [SFW]","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"oddlysatisfying","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6NYespd3jy62IgAehgvHjNFg8z9zBIlFefIn2ZrF5oQ.png","title":"Oddly Satisfying","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#00a6a5","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/65GJujMgAXbydbxxFPYm6eck1YffqR-anhX4-hxnVhQ.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[115,120],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9150416,"submit_text_label":"Texty-text text","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/oddlysatisfying","key_color":"#ff66ac","name":"t5_2x93b","created":1368595528,"url":"/r/oddlysatisfying/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1368595528,"banner_size":[1280,384],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"For those little things that are inexplicably satisfying.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"comics","title":"video games","ups":36844,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":["giphy","static","animated"],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":false,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2qh0s/styles/communityIcon_d0dg7ue8x5881.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d70a2d18530f5c0a662cb8f5acb3ab5cd64b1cf6","show_media":true,"description":"##About \\/r/Comics\n\n&gt; This subreddit is for everything related to print comics and web comics.

Still not sure? [Here](https://imgur.com/a/IxkAijD) is a compilation of some of the best blursed images\n\n###**Rule 2: Title Guidelines**\n\n* Titles must start with \"blursed\" or \"blursed_\". Titles should not exceed 5 words long (this means no sentences).\n\n###**Rule 3: No text or memes**\n\n* Memes, and submissions where text is needed to make the image blursed are not permitted. \n\n A meme is defined as an image that follows repetitive meme formats, or could be posted and allowed on subreddits such as r/memes or r/dankmemes. \n\n* A good rule of thumb is that if you can’t cross out all the text in the image and still have it be blursed, then there is too much text.\n\n###**Rule 4: NSFW, Offensive or Political Content**\n\n* NSFW content is not allowed, and will be removed. **Posting NSFW will incur a ban of at least 7 days.**\n\n* Offensive content will be removed under this rule. This includes content such as: Nazi-related posts, racism, terrorism-related content, etc.\n\n* Due to it's divisive nature, political content is banned. r/BlursedImages is for admiring the most blursed images on the internet, not for waging political arguments, and we want to keep it that way.\n\n###**Rule 5: No reposts**\n\n* No Reposting posts that are under 3 months old, anything with a flair, or has more than 5k upvotes.\n\n* Chainposts are also not allowed **and will lead to a ban of minimum 7 days**. A chainpost is usually an image asking you to repost it. Here's an [example](https://i.imgur.com/fNYCfqp.png).\n\n\n###**Rule 6: No Videos/GIFs**\n\n* Videos/GIFs are not allowed. Please go to r/blursed_videos for that.\n\n###**Rule 7: No low quality images**\n\n* This includes: \n\n 1) Distracting watermarks \n\n 2) Bad cropping \n\n 3) Low resolution images\n\n---\n\n####Sort by flair\n\n[a post of quality](https://www.reddit.com/r/blursedimages/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3Aa%2Bpost%2Bof%2Bquality) [announcement](http://reddit.com/r/blursedimages/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3Aannouncement)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"blursedimages","header_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/t99ovsuGI3Iiee8o_Zfq9V0mk2_FsFh7BLGH3wNywZ8.png","title":"Blursed Images","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#ffb000","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ADiDVhopzNWob4C_yR90K09N8yf9KJLjp2Ph6VoBV2Q.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a blursed image","header_size":[64,54],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":3343067,"submit_text_label":"Make announcement","link_flair_position":"right","display_name_prefixed":"r/blursedimages","key_color":"#46d160","name":"t5_j34kt","created":1526081786,"url":"/r/blursedimages/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1526081786,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Home of the most blursed images on the internet","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"funny","title":"My daughter just sent me this from school…","ups":34929,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9zfV0uAe-z008QZ0NJnHQ34o30cmLCN9-qBCgAZGcc0.png","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":null,"show_media":true,"description":"**Welcome to r/Funny:**\n\n\nYou may only post if you are funny. \n\n\n**Please read [our complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules) before posting.**\n\n-----\n\n[New to Reddit?
