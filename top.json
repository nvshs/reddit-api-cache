Post videos of perfectly cut screams (Screams do not need to be cut off by the ending of the video, however, the scream should be the focus)\n\n2.) No timestamp abusing (Editing clips to be a scream that otherwise wouldn't be)\n\n3.) Don't be racist or some shit ^(if somebody is being racist, snitch on them super hard)\n\n4.) Don't spoil stuff either. Nobody likes spoilers. If your content contains spoilers for something, please mark them as such. \n\n&gt; You can mark a spoiler by using the code &gt;! !&lt; ex. \\&gt;!spoiler text goes here!&lt; | Should look like.. &gt;!Endgame kills Infinity War!&lt;\n\n5.) No reposting. 4 months is the loose statute of limitations for reposting. If a video is 4 months old, it's probably fair game. \n\n6.) Absolutely no NSFL or animal cruelty. This is a friendly place. Just don't do it.\n\n7.) Try to keep videos short. There isn't a limit, this isn't YTHaiku or anything, but the shorter the better.\n\n8.) Do not upload a video, in full, of a video on youtube on v.reddit\n\n9.) No Minecraft except on Minecraft Mondays. Save all your posts up and unleash the fury every Monday.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n|||| **Sister Subreddits** ||||\n\n/r/MinecraftScreams \n\n/r/perfectlycutyeets \n\n/r/perfectlycutbarks\n\n/r/perfectlycatscreams\n\n/r/justa","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"perfectlycutscreams","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/H1e_48OB5Z_XwiwvsNUCXkeJVuwTs0aqdJ-CNr6ze3I.png","title":"Videos of perfectly cut scre-","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#d4145a","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xMWJpYPqLqSK9R_afYkZSIZ3nefL8A3YHsSZzPHJpIM.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a SCREEEEEE-","header_size":[1920,384],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":1883929,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/perfectlycutscreams","key_color":"#ddbd37","name":"t5_3n7fs","created":1501414832,"url":"/r/perfectlycutscreams/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1501414832,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"MadeMeSmile","title":"2 years sober, one day at a time.","ups":57917,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2uqcm/styles/communityIcon_kfqpkjbvpv001.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=01612176bef55554664a2909df8190aff3b8353c","show_media":true,"description":"[**New to reddit?

This is a happy place. Be respectful.\n\nComments or posts not in keeping with the tone of the sub will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nBullying, racism, homophobia and sexual comments in any form, comments or links, will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nIf the comment section gets too heated, it will get locked.\n\n###2. Audible and contagious laughing\n\nAll videos must contain contagious laughter.\n\nDo not post videos that are just funny because of a joke or a situation.\n\nAudience or edited in laughter does not count as contagious laughter.\n\nCompilations are mostly old and common reposts. Please refrain from posting them here.\n\nNo bullying or victimisation. No videos of people fighting or otherwise bad natured laughs.\n\n###3. Video length\n\nVideos must be at least 10 seconds long and have a good amount of laughing in them.\n\nIf the video is more than 1 minute long, please link directly to the specific moment when it is appropriate to start watching. Alternatively include the appropriate time code in the post title.\n\n###4. No reposts\n\nReposts may be removed to encourage fresh content.\n\nRemember to check top posts and search using keywords before you post.\n\nIt's also wise to check newest posts to see if someone has just posted the same viral video you are crossposting.\n\n###5. Post must have a proper title\n\nUse a descriptive title. Bad titles are hard to search and leads to more unnecessary reposts. Mods have the final word on what is considered a bad title.\n\nExamples of bad titles: \".\", \"title\", \"😂😂\", \"funny title\", \"wait for it\", \"this made me laugh\"\n\n###6. No content promotion\n\nThis subreddit is not your personal marketing place. No spamming in general.\n\n###7. No politics\n\nPolitical videos and arguments are not allowed and will be removed. Let's keep this sub politics free.","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"ContagiousLaughter","header_img":null,"title":"Contagious Laughter","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-aRiAKQyfxSEA8u0R1bBaiIaeXH0xBsJvGkNnKwTpiE.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a new video","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":6437429,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/ContagiousLaughter","key_color":"#ddbd37","name":"t5_2u2bh","created":1336564914,"url":"/r/ContagiousLaughter/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1336564914,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Something to put you in a good mood.\n\nVideos of people laughing infectiously.

No content involving people harming or harassing animals. Please do not submit sunrises, sunsets, or other content which does not have an element of 'wow-factor'. No posting of photoshopped or otherwise excessively and unnecessarily manipulated images.\n\n#####`2.` **Submission Titles**\n\n&gt; Every post title must begin with the fire emoji (🔥) and a space. The fire emoji defines this community. Your post will be automatically removed if you do not follow this rule.\n\n&gt;Titles should be accurate and descriptive: low effort titles will be removed. Include the animal/plant name, a location, and brief description to the best of your ability. Titles cannot say \"[Subject] is Lit\".\n\n#####`3.`  **Reposts**\n\n&gt;No posts that have been previously posted on this subreddit within 120 days (4 months) may be posted again. No posts that have previously been posted on this subreddit with over 10,000 upvotes in the past year may be posted again.\n\n&gt;Search the subreddit for key terms like the animal name before posting to check if your post is a repost. You can also use KarmaDecay and Google Reverse Image Search. Spamming many posts or excessive cross-posting in an attempt to karma farm will get you banned. \n\n#####`5.` **NSFW/L**  \n\n&gt;We do not allow NSFW content: bloody, gory and violent content can be redirected to our sister subreddit /r/natureismetal.\n\n\n#####`6.` **Human Concerns**  \n\n&gt; No politics, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, diet, or similar topics of human conceit.

These numbers are not high and don’t take long to achieve, but the exact numbers are hidden so karma farming bots can’t just meet them easily then come here. Please do not send us a message to inquire about our karma rules. It's a question we do not and will not answer, nor do we override.

Simple as that. If you have a problem with our decision, [send us a message.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor)\n\n If you're trying to troll, your post will be immediately removed and your account will be banned. This includes tricks where you try to get someone to google something different than what they expect. \n\n 2B.  **A social media screenshot that is *solely* about one personality responding to another personality is not necessarily humor**, and might be better suited for subreddits such as /r/CleverComebacks or /r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter . Anything that can be described as a \"flame war, slapfight, clap-back, or sick burn\" or anything remotely similar is not appropriate for this subreddit.  It MUST contain humor to be allowed here.\n\n\n3. **Pictures of only text are not allowed.** \n\n    Pictures of text with no graphics will be removed. No, changing the color of the background is not a graphic. Screenshots of social media and satire websites are allowed. \n\n4. **Images &amp; short GIFs only.**\n\n    Linking to news articles, websites or videos is prohibited.\n\n    Gifs are allowed as long as they are no longer than 10 seconds and contain NO audio.  \n\n    Images must directly link to the content you're posting. Please use Reddit's image host or [imgur](https://imgur.com/) if you can.\n\n   Any other content, including META posts, videos, advertisements and blog posts will be removed. Any of this disallowed content hiding within \"allowed\" content may be met with further action at moderator discretion.\n\n  Any meta posts should be posted on our special [complaint forum](https://i.imgur.com/FOKLgfe.png). Don't post them here. \n\n5. **Avoid reposts, flooding, and spam.** \n\n Use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) or [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) and check /new and the front page before you post. Unfortunately, due to recent Reddit changes, karmadecay is not as effective, so we have a pretty light hand with repost violations and are not likely to ban you if you make a mistake. \n\n Do not post more than 4 posts in a 24 hour period.  \n\n6. **Be civil: No racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.** \n\n  The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team. \n\n  Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance. \n\n  If you're a jerk, including use of \"tard\" or anything related to a racial supremacist ideology, you'll be shown the door. \n\n  If you're intentionally trolling, including \"google games,\" you will be banned. \n\n7. **Do not brigade.** \n\n  Coming to this community en masse specifically to harass our users, or setting up a post or thread here referring to another subreddit or thread causes a lot of problems for everyone. If we suspect you're doing it, you will be banned. \n\n ___7b.___  **No \"Meta\" Posts.**\n\n Meta posts about this subreddit, or posts referencing any other subreddit are not allowed due to sitewide rules and brigading problems. This includes links to, or screen-shots of any other subreddit and or any other sub's comment section.\n\n\n8. **Follow Reddit's global rules.** Submissions failing to follow [Reddit's content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) will be removed. Basically, if you are trying to sell your T-Shirts or flip flops or sexbot site, or if you're a terrorist, you're gonna be booted. \n\n9. **No pointing at offsite resources**\n\n  Due to spam and foreign disinformation campaigns that have targeted Reddit in the past (including /r/PoliticalHumor in 2015-2016), we are banning any images that reference or bear the image of Facebook groups, other watermarks, or individual websites not ranked highly on Alexa Website Rankings.\n\n  This includes screenshots of dubious news sites, watermarks, and certain social media accounts posing as something they are not. This does NOT include political cartoons, screenshots of individual Twitter posts, or established satirical websites.\n\n###Enforcement Policy \n\n\n* **Moderators will enforce the rules at their sole discretion.** \n\n* You may ask for clarification of a removal by [messaging the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor) with a link to your post or comment. \n\n* To appeal a ban, respond to your original ban message.
