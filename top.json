No related posts\n&gt; Posts that acknowledge, \"one-up,\" or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. \"I see your X and raise you Y\")\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###3. No x-posts or reposts\n&gt; Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.\n\n&gt; **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post.

Original [OC] photographs only\n&gt; **a.** No gifs, videos, or websites.  \n\n&gt; **b.** All submissions must be original content. If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.  \n\n&gt; **c.** Software glitches/errors, overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed, although you may censor personal information per Reddit-wide rules.\n\n&gt; **d.** Side by side images are okay if they adhere to the rest of the rules.\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###5. No screenshots\n\n&gt; No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab. This means no images of screens, pictures of screens taken with a different device, images that have been partially or fully generated by a computer, or pictures of printed out screenshots. Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n&gt; **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n&gt; **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n&gt; **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image.

When doing giveaways please keep it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but don't mandate subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don't make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.\r\n* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to be external and/or to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).\r\n* Even if you do a giveaway, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere without prior mod approval.\r\n* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.\r\n* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner's location is allowed).\r\n* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways. If you start it, someone must win it. You cannot delete your giveaway once you post it.\r\n* Giveaways shouldn't last an absurd amount of time, nor should they be absurdly difficult to enter or win.\r\n* Do not choose your giveaway winners based on the number of upvotes or downvotes they get.\r\n* Giveaways to benefit registered charities must be verified by moderators. All other requests for donations (monetary or otherwise) are not allowed as per rule #8.\r\n* Only one entry per user to any giveaway unless otherwise stated by the giveaway poster.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck the PCMR communities elsewhere:\r\n\r\n[Twitter](//rebrand.ly/pcmrtwitter)\r\n\r\n[Facebook Page](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfaceboo)\r\n\r\n[Facebook Group](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfbgroup)\r\n\r\n[YouTube](//rebrand.ly/pcmryoutube)\r\n\r\n[Steam Group](/rebrand.ly/pcmrsteam)\r\n\r\n[Steam Curator](//rebrand.ly/pcmrcurator)\r\n\r\n[Instagram](//rebrand.ly/pcmrinstagram)\r\n\r\n[Twitch](//rebrand.ly/pcmrtwitch)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nChats:\r\n\r\n[Discord](//rebrand.ly/pcmrdiscord)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCharity: \r\n\r\n[F@H](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfold)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### [](#social)\r\n\r\n&gt; * [Website](//rebrand.ly/pcmr \"Website\")\r\n&gt; * [Twitter](//rebrand.ly/pcmrtwitter \"Twitter\")\r\n&gt; * [Discord](//rebrand.ly/pcmrdiscord \"Discord\")\r\n&gt; * [Instagram](//rebrand.ly/pcmrinstagram \"Instagram\")\r\n&gt; * [YouTube](//rebrand.ly/pcmryoutube \"YouTube\")\r\n&gt; * [Page](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfacebook \"Facebook\")\r\n&gt; * [Group](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfbgroup \"Facebook\")\r\n&gt; * [Group](//rebrand.ly/pcmrsteam \"Steam\")\r\n&gt; * [Curator](//rebrand.ly/pcmrcurator \"Steam\")\r\n\r\n[](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"pcmasterrace","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_87YiajqYLK6ZC4Qaby2raibpx1cymdx5bP1PWwlDLo.png","title":"PC Master Race - PCMR: A place where all enthusiasts of PC, PC gaming and PC technology are welcome!","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#ffcd00","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PN7Sv1axRx971W5-d_e-IC_RMiP2Sso8IqdRGq3UY9Y.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a glorious link","header_size":[800,800],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":7317536,"submit_text_label":"Submit a glorious text post","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/pcmasterrace","key_color":"#ff8717","name":"t5_2sgp1","created":1304179207,"url":"/r/pcmasterrace/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1304179207,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Welcome to the official subreddit of the PC Master Race / PCMR!\n\nAll PC related content is welcome, including build help, tech support, and any doubt one might have about PC ownership.\n\nYou don't necessarily need a PC to be a member of the PCMR.

Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title.

HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned.

We have cookies and UNLIMITED POWER!\n\n###[discord](https://discord.gg/msnKMcPq2p)\n\n*****\n\nDid you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.\n*****\n*****\n\n\n##Rules:\n\n##1. No metagaming\n\n##2. Don't be an asshole\n\n##3. Posts must be memes of the Star Wars Prequels.\n\n##4. Posts inappropriate for viewing in public, like at work, must be tagged NSFW.\n\n##5. No politics.\n\n##6. No edgy or inflammatory posts.\n\n##7. No brigading/encouraging brigading.\n\n##8. No encouraging subreddit drama.\n\n##9. No annoying bots or novelty accounts\n\n##10. No short-term reposts\n\n##11. No low-effort posts\n\n##12. No promotion\n\n##13. No misinformation\n\n##14. No spam\n\n*****\n\n##Details: \n\n1\\. No upvote/karma/awards/subscriber related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban. Cakeday posts also fall under this rule.\n\n2\\. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc. This includes being aggressive or impolite to other users, most likely from some sort of disagreement. We do not care who “started it” when a pair of users are acting this way. Just report someone if they are acting that way and we will handle it.\n\n3\\. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. \"Prequel\" refers to any media that takes place before the beginning of A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas, EU content, and video games. Note that single pictures of a character (e.g. \"Just a picture of Obi-Wan\") do not necessarily count as memes, and may be seen as a violation of Rule 1. Additionally, all posts must make an attempt at humor. All posts must be made *from* prequel-content or *about* prequel content.\n\n4\\. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother. NSFW posts that are not porn should be marked as NSFW. Kids come here, use your head. If you wouldn’t be comfortable with a 12 year old on their iPad seeing your content, best to mark it NSFW to be safe. In addition to this, do not sexualize minors on this sub. Including that notorious copypasta.\n\n5\\. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. /r/PrequelMemes is meant to be a refuge from the extreme political divisiveness you see on nearly every Reddit community every day. Even if an issue seems black and white to you, it is not to be discussed on the subreddit. As a result, we don't allow anything that would bring politics in. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts related to politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics or social-issues.\n\n6\\. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. This includes those edgy memes that involve autism or school shootings. /r/PrequelMemes is about humor for everyone involved. If your humor is derived from upsetting/mocking others, probably not a good community for you. With that said, we do not simply remove every meme that someone might disagree with.\n\n7\\. Brigading, in reddit terms, is the encouragement of mass downvoting and invading of another subreddit. This is forbidden by Reddit's TOS, and, likewise, our rules. Brigading includes linking to subreddits and telling people to downvote their content. This also extends to things outside of reddit, like polls, videos, etc. Basically anything that constitutes a call to action. Brigading coordinated from /r/PrequelMemes or in the name of /r/PrequelMemes is subject to any repercussions on this sub.\n\n8\\. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start “meme wars”, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit’s mods. Very similar to rules 6 and 7, but also applies internally to causing drama in /r/PrequelMemes. Causing drama could include being intentionally aggressive to other users, baiting users into breaking rules, etc.\n\n9\\. No accounts, bot or novelty, that spam the sub or otherwise only occupy space on the sub without offering any actual merit. If your bot gets banned and you are willing to change it to meet our requirements, use mod mail to find out what needs to be changed.\n\n10\\. Here are the requirements for reposts:\n\n* Posts must be at least 6 months old before you can repost them\n\n* It also must be 6 months since the last time it was posted \n\n* All reposts must be flaired to indicate as such\n\n* OP must provide the source of the original in the comments\n\n11\\. This one is pretty simple. Post good memes that will make people laugh. Give it a good title. For the title, if you can't think of anything, slap on a loosely-related prequel quote and you are golden. Also, don’t put the caption in the title; the post must be a meme on its own if it didn’t have the title. This rule also prohibits screenshots. This includes text conversations showing someone's reaction to a meme and pictures of polls with the “I love democracy” macro slapped below it.\n\n12\\. Do not do anything that constitutes advertising or promoting anything not officially associated with the subreddit. This includes posting links to them, giving instructions on how to find them, etc. This rule generally prohibits store pages, Youtube channels, Instagram accounts, other subreddits, and discord servers, although [there are exceptions](https://old.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/wiki/rules#wiki_exceptions11)\n\n13\\. Do not convey rumors in a way that would lead people to believe they are factual. Do not spread information you know to be false. If something might not be true, make that clear in your post. This includes anything from leaks to unofficial sources of information.\n\n14\\. I cannot believe we need to make this a rule. It should be obvious. Do not post the same thing multiple times. Do not post a comment multiple times. Do not promote scams.\n\n[See the full rules, complete with examples, exceptions, and consequences, for more details.](https://old.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/wiki/rules)\n\n*****\n\nOther Star Wars Meme subs:\n\n \n\n /r/SequelMemes - /r/OTMemes - /r/The_Valkorion - /r/AnthologyMemes - /r/KOTORMemes\n\nOther Star Wars Sub Affiliations\n\n/r/StarWarsSpeculation\n\n******\nCSS by /u/Illummix\n******\nWant to use spicy emotes on this sub?
