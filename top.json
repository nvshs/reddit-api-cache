Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned.

Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

Violation of this rule may result in a ban\n\n2. **Posts must depict humans actually being bros.** Please do not post humans engaging in normal human behavior which might simply appeal to humans.\n\n3. **No reliance on additional context.**  The 'bro' action should be easily discernible within the image/gif/video. Having to add context in the title, comments, super-imposed text or otherwise to explain the 'bro' is against sub rules.  Submissions violating this rule will be removed\n\n4. **No reposts.** All reposts are removed at moderators discretion.  Repost farming is not allowed and will result in a ban.  Check the sub prior to posting to see if your submission has already been posted\n\n5.  **NSFW content.** NSFW content is sometimes okay here, but it must be flagged appropriately.  We do not allow any content related to suicide, or suicide prevention.  No rage bait submissions.  Any content that is sexually suggestive or contains drug use is grounds for a permanent ban\n\n6. **No Spam.** Original content and crossposts from other subreddits are welcome, but we do not allow posts promoting a specific website, YouTube channel, blog, subreddit etc. Such posts will be removed, reported as spam, and you will be banned. Creating a post for the sole purpose to redirect to another subreddit will be removed as spam\n\n7. **No staged submissions.** Scenes set up to look helpful are staged and will be removed.  Staged videos made by content creators for clout on TikTok, YouTube or Instagram will also be removed at moderators discretion.  No poverty porn or exploitative media.  We do not allow skits or social experiment videos.\n\n8. **No memes, comics, or compilations.** Refrain from posting jokes, memes, puns, reaction gifs and wordplays. No compilation videos, gifs, pictures, etc.\n\n9. **No Fundraising/Request/Donation Posts.** This includes any post or comment asking for people to perform a 'bro' action. Examples include: attending funerals, mailing cards, petitions, joining livestreams, and GoFundMe campaigns. Moderators will ban those violating this rule.\n\n10. **No spreading misinformation.** Sharing a source and debating that source or topic in a fair and reasonable manner (i.e., without personal attacks) is encouraged. Do not make wildly unsubstantiated and/or outlandish claims without the ability to share a source.\n\n11. **No posts or comments directly about politics and no bringing politics into a post or comment not about politics.  No war related content.  No posts centered around police**\n\n12.  **No text only submissions.** This includes screenshots of text messages, twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Reddit screenshots from other communities will be reviewed on a case by case basis.

Do not attempt to circumvent this rule by any means.\r\n* [**Rule #4**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.234) Screenshots of Reddit, Facebook, Youtube, and other site's comments should have the usernames blacked out (including yours). Celebrities are the exception, as long as you respect rule #1.\r\n* [**Rule #5**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.235) No affiliate/referral links or codes.\r\n* [**Rule #6**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.236) The following will be removed at moderator discretion: \r\n - 6.1: Content that is either low quality, unrelated, especially unoriginal, or low-effort (including, but not limited to: simple website/software bugs, steam/product reviews, comedic product/system specs, steam gift messages, screenshots of conversations, internet speed test results, negligible price reductions, items that aren't PC related, even if they are named similarly or resemble it, online petitions and surveys that aren't academic in nature (and have been pre-approved by the mod team).\r\n - 6.2: Pictures of purchase or shipping related notifications and information.\r\n - 6.3: Blatant reposts/fad-chasing.\r\n - 6.4: Reaction content (images/gifs/memes), unless very high-quality/especially original.\r\n - 6.5: [Concern trolling](//goo.gl/TPnnnw).\r\n - 6.6: Feigning idiocy when posting or commenting, or linking to such content.\r\n* [**Rule #7**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.237) Age, nationality, race, gender, ability, sexuality, religion, political affiliation and economic status are all irrelevant here. All are welcome in the PC Master Race. Also, linking the PC Master Race with racial supremacy or any kind of fascist ideologies, or making distasteful analogies in this regard, is not acceptable in the slightest.\r\n* [**Rule #8**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.238) No begging. No [soft begging](https://goo.gl/4J9rq6). No Implicit or explicit trading. No buying. No Selling. No asking for valuation. No asking how or where to do these either.\r\n* [**Rule #9**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.239) Message the mods first, and wait for permission, if your post/comment is NSFW. Do not mark your post as NSFW or as Spoiler unless it actually is NSFW or a Spoiler.\r\n* [**Rule #10**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.2310) Screenshots of \"peasantry,\" including but not limited to conversations on Reddit, other websites or sms/chat screenshots where ignorance is being spewed and/or ridiculed, must be text posts.\r\n\r\n#Giveaway Rules\r\n\r\nFor an in-depth explanation of our giveaway rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_giveaway_rules).\r\n\r\n* The Master Race is generous. When doing giveaways please keep it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but don't mandate subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don't make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.\r\n* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to be external and/or to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).\r\n* Even if you do a giveaway, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere without prior mod approval.\r\n* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.\r\n* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner's location is allowed).\r\n* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways. If you start it, someone must win it. You cannot delete your giveaway once you post it.\r\n* Giveaways shouldn't last an absurd amount of time, nor should they be absurdly difficult to enter or win.\r\n* Do not choose your giveaway winners based on the number of upvotes or downvotes they get.\r\n* Giveaways to benefit registered charities must be verified by moderators. All other requests for donations (monetary or otherwise) are not allowed as per rule #8.\r\n* Only one entry per user to any giveaway unless otherwise stated by the giveaway poster.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck the PCMR communities elsewhere:\r\n\r\n[Twitter](//rebrand.ly/pcmrtwitter)\r\n\r\n[Facebook Page](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfaceboo)\r\n\r\n[Facebook Group](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfbgroup)\r\n\r\n[YouTube](//rebrand.ly/pcmryoutube)\r\n\r\n[Steam Group](/rebrand.ly/pcmrsteam)\r\n\r\n[Steam Curator](//rebrand.ly/pcmrcurator)\r\n\r\n[Instagram](//rebrand.ly/pcmrinstagram)\r\n\r\n[Twitch](//rebrand.ly/pcmrtwitch)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nChats:\r\n\r\n[Discord](//rebrand.ly/pcmrdiscord)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCharity: \r\n\r\n[F@H](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfold)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### [](#social)\r\n\r\n&gt; * [Website](//rebrand.ly/pcmr \"Website\")\r\n&gt; * [Twitter](//rebrand.ly/pcmrtwitter \"Twitter\")\r\n&gt; * [Discord](//rebrand.ly/pcmrdiscord \"Discord\")\r\n&gt; * [Instagram](//rebrand.ly/pcmrinstagram \"Instagram\")\r\n&gt; * [YouTube](//rebrand.ly/pcmryoutube \"YouTube\")\r\n&gt; * [Page](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfacebook \"Facebook\")\r\n&gt; * [Group](//rebrand.ly/pcmrfbgroup \"Facebook\")\r\n&gt; * [Group](//rebrand.ly/pcmrsteam \"Steam\")\r\n&gt; * [Curator](//rebrand.ly/pcmrcurator \"Steam\")\r\n\r\n[](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"pcmasterrace","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_87YiajqYLK6ZC4Qaby2raibpx1cymdx5bP1PWwlDLo.png","title":"PC Master Race - PCMR: A place where all enthusiasts of PC, PC gaming and PC technology are welcome!","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#ffcd00","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PN7Sv1axRx971W5-d_e-IC_RMiP2Sso8IqdRGq3UY9Y.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a glorious link","header_size":[800,800],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":7498622,"submit_text_label":"Submit a glorious text post","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/pcmasterrace","key_color":"#ff8717","name":"t5_2sgp1","created":1304179207,"url":"/r/pcmasterrace/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1304179207,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Welcome to the official subreddit of the PC Master Race / PCMR!\n\nAll PC related content is welcome, including build help, tech support, and any doubt one might have about PC ownership.\n\nYou don't necessarily need a PC to be a member of the PCMR.
