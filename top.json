All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you‚Ä¶\" or \"When they‚Ä¶\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators‚Äô discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no ‚ÄúCake Day‚Äù posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed. Try /r/NSFWfunny. Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social media or electronic messaging content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed. This includes anything from Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, or any form of \"comments section\" on the Internet, as well as [content accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Images with SnapChat text added are allowed, as long as all UI elements have been removed.

This is a happy place. Be respectful.\n\nComments or posts not in keeping with the tone of the sub will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nBullying, racism, homophobia and sexual comments in any form, comments or links, will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nIf the comment section gets too heated, it will get locked.\n\n###2. Audible and contagious laughing\n\nAll videos must contain contagious laughter.\n\nDo not post videos that are just funny because of a joke or a situation.\n\nAudience or edited in laughter does not count as contagious laughter.\n\nCompilations are mostly old and common reposts. Please refrain from posting them here.\n\nNo bullying or victimisation. No videos of people fighting or otherwise bad natured laughs.\n\n###3. Video length\n\nVideos must be at least 10 seconds long and have a good amount of laughing in them.\n\nIf the video is more than 1 minute long, please link directly to the specific moment when it is appropriate to start watching. Alternatively include the appropriate time code in the post title.\n\n###4. No reposts\n\nReposts may be removed to encourage fresh content.\n\nRemember to check top posts and search using keywords before you post.\n\nIt's also wise to check newest posts to see if someone has just posted the same viral video you are crossposting.\n\n###5. Post must have a proper title\n\nUse a descriptive title. Bad titles are hard to search and leads to more unnecessary reposts. Mods have the final word on what is considered a bad title.\n\nExamples of bad titles: \".\", \"title\", \"üòÇüòÇ\", \"funny title\", \"wait for it\", \"this made me laugh\"\n\n###6. No content promotion\n\nThis subreddit is not your personal marketing place. No spamming in general.\n\n###7. No politics\n\nPolitical videos and arguments are not allowed and will be removed. Let's keep this sub politics free.","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"ContagiousLaughter","header_img":null,"title":"Contagious Laughter","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":null,"primary_color":"","icon_img":"","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a new video","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":5991157,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/ContagiousLaughter","key_color":"#ddbd37","name":"t5_2u2bh","created":1336564914,"url":"/r/ContagiousLaughter/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1336564914,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Something to put you in a good mood.\n\nVideos of people laughing infectiously.

Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.
