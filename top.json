Submissions\n\n* ####Guidelines:\n\n* Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology\n\n* Self posts must contribute positively to /r/technology and foster reasonable discussion. Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable.\n\n* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions in the technological world.\n\n* ####Please do not submit the following:\n\n* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.\n\n* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. \n\n* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).\n\n* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.\n\n* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).\n\n* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.\n\n* vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.\n\n* viii) Social media links/profiles/invites or promotions (eg. Facebook, Instagram, Pintrest etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. \n\n##2. Behaviour\n\n* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, trolling or bigotry in any form are therefore not allowed and will be removed. Repeated abuse can result in a permanent ban.\n\n##3. Titles\n\n* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote, which must:\n\n* adequately describe the content\n\n* adequately describe the content's relation to technology\n\n* be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning. \n\n##4. Flair\n\n* Please flair your submission appropriately. [An extended guide to flairing can be found here, in the wiki](/r/technology/wiki/flair).\n\n##5. Reddit-wide rules.\n\n* [All reddit-wide rules apply here](/rules). Do not [spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F). No Self Promotion.\n\n***\n\n##Miscellanea\n\n* If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) with your reason.\n\n* Want to host an AMA? Please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).\n\n* Our /u/AutoModerator configuration may be viewed [here](https://imgur.com/a/EOi0n). \n\n* Removed posts will either be given a removal reason flair and/or comment response; please message the moderators if this did not occur.\n\n* All legitimate, answerable modmail inquiries or suggestions will be answered to the best of our abilities within a reasonable period of time. \n\n#Related Subreddits\n\n## Technology\n\n* /r/AskTechnology\n* /r/Futurology\n* /r/Gadgets\n* /r/Hardware\n* /r/Tech\n* /r/Technews\n* /r/Realtech\n* /r/PCMasterRace\n* /r/BuildAPC\n* /r/BuildAPCSales\n* /r/InternetIsBeautiful \n* /r/RenewableEnergy\n* /r/SelfDrivingCars\n* /r/TechSupport\n* /r/TalesFromTechSupport\n* /r/TechSupportGore\n* /r/TechnologyPorn\n* /r/ImaginaryTechnology\n* /r/Kickstarter\n* /r/homeautomation\n\n##PROGRAMMING\n\n* /r/Programming\n* /r/Learnprogramming\n* [Language-Specific Communities](/r/programming/wiki/faq#wiki_what_language_reddits_are_there.3F)\n* /r/CScareerquestions\n* /r/CompSci\n* /r/NetSec\n* /r/Engineering\n* /r/Hacking\n\n\n##OS's\n\n* /r/Windows\n* /r/OSX\n* /r/Linux\n* /r/Ubuntu\n* /r/Debian\n* /r/Archlinux\n* /r/Raspberry_pi\n* /r/Chromeos\n* /r/ReactOS\n* /r/RemixOS\n* /r/Android\n* /r/iOS\n* /r/Jailbreak\n* /r/LineageOS\n\n##SOFTWARE\n\n* /r/Software\n* /r/Firefox\n* /r/Chrome\n* /r/Photoshop \n* /r/Kodi \n\n##POPULAR COMPANIES\n\n* /r/Google\n* /r/Microsoft\n* /r/Apple\n* /r/Amazon\n* /r/Startups\n\n##CRYPTOCURRENCIES\n\n* /r/CryptoCurrency\n* /r/Ethereum\n* /r/BTC\n* /r/Bitcoin\n* /r/Steem\n\n##CAMPAIGNS\n\n* /r/KeepOurNetFree \n* /r/pirateparty \n* /r/privacy","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"technology","header_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/VwBugImhQhFTJhC0HjM9IWyEEEF898HHtI2AunD5SW4.png","title":"/r/Technology ","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/J_fCwTYJkoM-way-eaOHv8AOHoF_jNXNqOvPrQ7bINY.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[40,61],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":13960255,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/technology","key_color":"#0dd3bb","name":"t5_2qh16","created":1201231675,"url":"/r/technology/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1201231675,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Subreddit dedicated to the news and discussions about the creation and use of technology and its surrounding issues.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"OldSchoolCool","title":"Members of the Wearable Computing Project at MIT.
