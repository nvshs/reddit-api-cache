No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned.

If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but âfactoidâ text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned.

Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title.

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When youâ¦\" or \"When theyâ¦\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderatorsâ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no âCake Dayâ posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed. Try /r/NSFWfunny. Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social media or electronic messaging content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed.

Submissions\n\n* ####Guidelines:\n\n* Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to technology\n\n* Self posts must contribute positively to /r/technology and foster reasonable discussion. Self-post cross-posts are not acceptable.\n\n* Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently within the context of technology in that they either view the events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions in the technological world.\n\n* ####Please do not submit the following:\n\n* i) Submissions violating the guidelines.\n\n* ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions `video` in the URL, it's not suitable. \n\n* iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to /r/techsupport, /r/AskTechnology, another relevant community or our weekly [Support Saturday threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=flair%3ATechSupport&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).\n\n* iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding (Including ICOs) - submissions of this nature will be removed.\n\n* v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be submitted to /r/TechnologyTalk, or [messaged to the moderators of the subreddit](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).\n\n* vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer support.\n\n* vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.\n\n* viii) Social media links/profiles/invites or promotions (eg. Facebook, Instagram, Pintrest etc). Tweets should not be used as a news source unless an official announcement by a verified company or spokesperson. \n\n##2. Behaviour\n\n* **Remember the human** You are advised to abide by [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette); it will be enforced when user behaviour is no longer deemed to be suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks, abusive language, trolling or bigotry in any form are therefore not allowed and will be removed. Repeated abuse can result in a permanent ban.\n\n##3. Titles\n\n* Submissions **must** use either the articles title and optionally a subtitle. Or, ***only*** if neither are accurate, a suitable quote, which must:\n\n* adequately describe the content\n\n* adequately describe the content's relation to technology\n\n* be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning. \n\n##4. Flair\n\n* Please flair your submission appropriately. [An extended guide to flairing can be found here, in the wiki](/r/technology/wiki/flair).\n\n##5. Reddit-wide rules.\n\n* [All reddit-wide rules apply here](/rules). Do not [spam](/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F). No Self Promotion.\n\n***\n\n##Miscellanea\n\n* If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology) with your reason.\n\n* Want to host an AMA? Please [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftechnology).\n\n* Our /u/AutoModerator configuration may be viewed [here](https://imgur.com/a/EOi0n). \n\n* Removed posts will either be given a removal reason flair and/or comment response; please message the moderators if this did not occur.\n\n* All legitimate, answerable modmail inquiries or suggestions will be answered to the best of our abilities within a reasonable period of time. \n\n#Related Subreddits\n\n## Technology\n\n* /r/AskTechnology\n* /r/Futurology\n* /r/Gadgets\n* /r/Hardware\n* /r/Tech\n* /r/Technews\n* /r/Realtech\n* /r/PCMasterRace\n* /r/BuildAPC\n* /r/BuildAPCSales\n* /r/InternetIsBeautiful \n* /r/RenewableEnergy\n* /r/SelfDrivingCars\n* /r/TechSupport\n* /r/TalesFromTechSupport\n* /r/TechSupportGore\n* /r/TechnologyPorn\n* /r/ImaginaryTechnology\n* /r/Kickstarter\n* /r/Homeautomation\n* /r/Artificial\n\n##PROGRAMMING\n\n* /r/Programming\n* /r/Learnprogramming\n* [Language-Specific Communities](/r/programming/wiki/faq#wiki_what_language_reddits_are_there.3F)\n* /r/CScareerquestions\n* /r/CompSci\n* /r/NetSec\n* /r/Engineering\n* /r/Hacking\n\n\n##OS's\n\n* /r/Windows\n* /r/OSX\n* /r/Linux\n* /r/Ubuntu\n* /r/Debian\n* /r/Archlinux\n* /r/Raspberry_pi\n* /r/Chromeos\n* /r/ReactOS\n* /r/RemixOS\n* /r/Android\n* /r/iOS\n* /r/Jailbreak\n* /r/LineageOS\n\n##SOFTWARE\n\n* /r/Software\n* /r/Firefox\n* /r/Chrome\n* /r/Photoshop \n* /r/Kodi \n\n##POPULAR COMPANIES\n\n* /r/Google\n* /r/Microsoft\n* /r/Apple\n* /r/Amazon\n* /r/Startups\n\n##CRYPTOCURRENCIES\n\n* /r/CryptoCurrency\n* /r/Ethereum\n* /r/BTC\n* /r/Bitcoin\n\n##CAMPAIGNS\n\n* /r/KeepOurNetFree \n* /r/Pirateparty \n* /r/Privacy","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"technology","header_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/VwBugImhQhFTJhC0HjM9IWyEEEF898HHtI2AunD5SW4.png","title":"/r/Technology ","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/J_fCwTYJkoM-way-eaOHv8AOHoF_jNXNqOvPrQ7bINY.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[40,61],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":13987527,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/technology","key_color":"#0dd3bb","name":"t5_2qh16","created":1201231675,"url":"/r/technology/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1201231675,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Subreddit dedicated to the news and discussions about the creation and use of technology and its surrounding issues.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}}]
