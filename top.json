Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

This includes build help, tech support, and any kind of doubt one might have about PC ownership.\r\n* You don't necessarily need a PC to be a member of the PCMR. You just have to love PCs. It's not about the hardware in your rig, but [the software in your heart!](//twitter.com/PedroPCMR/status/570009579637092352)\r\n* This is not a satirical or 'circlejerk subreddit'. [Nor did it start as one](//pcmasterrace.org/history). This is a [normal subreddit with occasional tongue-in-cheek humor elements](//pcmasterrace.org/community). We are a community where many of its members share similar opinions about the main topics, and sometimes end up having private jokes amongst ourselves.  We are not a community where members feign stupidity when posting and commenting because they find it funny. You can be banned if you conduct yourself like that here.\r\n* Owning a console does not necessarily make you a ['peasant'](//pcmasterrace.org/consolepeasants).\r\n* We created Reddit's most popular [Wiki](/r/pcmasterrace/w/).\r\n* If needed, you can [message the team behind PCMR](//reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/pcmasterrace).\r\n\r\n---\r\n#[Rules](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules)\r\n\r\nFor an in-depth explanation of our rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules).\r\n\r\n* [**Rule #1**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.231) Harassment of others is strictly forbidden. We will not tolerate any kind of incitement to action against anyone, nor will we allow the posting of information that can be used to harm others (celebrities or not).\r\n* [**Rule #2**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.232) We will not allow behavior contrary to [PCMR Etiquette](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/etiquette), e.g. brigading, witch-hunting, asking for upvotes or downvotes, enabling piracy, flamebaiting, clickbaiting, intentional rudeness, text spamming, using all caps or emojis/smileys/emoticons in titles or overusing them in comments, meta-reddit or meta-subreddit drama or complaints.\r\n* [**Rule #3**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.233) Don't link to threads in other subreddits. This includes NP links and archived links. Do not attempt to circumvent this rule by any means.\r\n* [**Rule #4**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.234) Screenshots of Reddit, Facebook, Youtube, and other site's comments should have the usernames blacked out (including yours). Celebrities are the exception, as long as you respect rule #1.\r\n* [**Rule #5**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.235) No affiliate/referral links or codes.\r\n* [**Rule #6**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.236) The following will be removed at moderator discretion: \r\n - 6.1: Content that is either low quality, unrelated, especially unoriginal, or low-effort (including, but not limited to: simple website/software bugs, steam/product reviews, comedic product/system specs, steam gift messages, screenshots of conversations, internet speed test results, negligible price reductions, items that aren't PC related, even if they are named similarly or resemble it, online petitions and surveys that aren't academic in nature (and have been pre-approved by the mod team).\r\n - 6.2: Pictures of purchase or shipping related notifications and information.\r\n - 6.3: Blatant reposts/fad-chasing.\r\n - 6.4: Reaction content (images/gifs/memes), unless very high-quality/especially original.\r\n - 6.5: [Concern trolling](//goo.gl/TPnnnw).\r\n - 6.6: Feigning idiocy when posting or commenting, or linking to such content.\r\n* [**Rule #7**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.237) Age, nationality, race, gender, ability, sexuality, religion, political affiliation and economic status are all irrelevant here. All are welcome in the PC Master Race. Also, linking the PC Master Race with racial supremacy or any kind of fascist ideologies, or making distasteful analogies in this regard, is not acceptable in the slightest.\r\n* [**Rule #8**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.238) No begging. No [soft begging](https://goo.gl/4J9rq6). No Implicit or explicit trading. No buying. No Selling. No asking for valuation. No asking how or where to do these either.\r\n* [**Rule #9**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.239) Message the mods first, and wait for permission, if your post/comment is NSFW. Do not mark your post as NSFW or as Spoiler unless it actually is NSFW or a Spoiler.\r\n* [**Rule #10**](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_rule_.2310) Screenshots of \"peasantry,\" including but not limited to conversations on Reddit, other websites or sms/chat screenshots where ignorance is being spewed and/or ridiculed, must be text posts.\r\n\r\n#Giveaway Rules\r\n\r\nFor an in-depth explanation of our giveaway rules don't forget to check our [rules wiki page](/r/pcmasterrace/w/rules#wiki_giveaway_rules).\r\n\r\n* The Master Race is generous. When doing giveaways please keep it within the bounds of our subreddit and only for subreddit members. Feel free to give prizes as you see fit, but don't mandate subscriptions or other benefits. You can post about your channel or project, but don't make it a requirement to visit, comment or subscribe to an external place to enter a giveaway or to increase the likelihood of winning.\r\n* Under special circumstances, we allow giveaways to be external and/or to require users to visit a page outside the subreddit, but that must conform to our [outside giveaway guidelines](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/rules#wiki_outside_giveaway_guidelines).\r\n* Even if you do a giveaway, you can not directly promote a specific giveaway happening elsewhere without prior mod approval.\r\n* Please [avoid posting keys in plain text or on images](/3ys6wv). Consider PMs as a safer way to hand out keys.\r\n* Users giving away physical items must provide photo proof of ownership (including their username and date) in the giveaway thread. Shipping fees must be entirely financed by the user doing the giveaway (limiting the winner's location is allowed).\r\n* No conditional (I will only giveaway if) giveaways.
