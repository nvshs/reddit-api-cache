Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but âfactoidâ text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam. If you are a new reddit user, please gain some karma and wait before posting.

This is a happy place. Be respectful.\n\nComments or posts not in keeping with the tone of the sub will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nBullying, racism, homophobia and sexual comments in any form, comments or links, will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nIf the comment section gets too heated, it will get locked.\n\n###2. Audible and contagious laughing\n\nAll videos must contain contagious laughter.\n\nDo not post videos that are just funny because of a joke or a situation.\n\nAudience or edited in laughter does not count as contagious laughter.\n\nCompilations are mostly old and common reposts. Please refrain from posting them here.\n\nNo bullying or victimisation. No videos of people fighting or otherwise bad natured laughs.\n\n###3. Video length\n\nVideos must be at least 10 seconds long and have a good amount of laughing in them.\n\nIf the video is more than 1 minute long, please link directly to the specific moment when it is appropriate to start watching. Alternatively include the appropriate time code in the post title.\n\n###4. No reposts\n\nReposts may be removed to encourage fresh content.\n\nRemember to check top posts and search using keywords before you post.\n\nIt's also wise to check newest posts to see if someone has just posted the same viral video you are crossposting.\n\n###5. Post must have a proper title\n\nUse a descriptive title. Bad titles are hard to search and leads to more unnecessary reposts. Mods have the final word on what is considered a bad title.\n\nExamples of bad titles: \".\", \"title\", \"ðð\", \"funny title\", \"wait for it\", \"this made me laugh\"\n\n###6.

This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).\n####What does \"Oddly Satisfying\" mean?\nWe are forever searching for a \"true definition\". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* \"oddly satisfying\" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.\n\n***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**\n\n######Rules:\n**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**\n###1)  **Banned Topics:**\nWe have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:\n\n* **Memes or image macros**\n\n* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as \"2048\", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.\n\n* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.\n\n* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).\n\n* **Compilation Albums/Videos**\n  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**\n  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).\n  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.\n\n* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.\n\n* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. \n\n###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** \nNSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (\"Say it, don't show it.\"). \n\n###3)  **Reposts:** \n**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.\n\n* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.\n\n* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as \"My...\", \"Mine...\", \"Our...\", \"We...\", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.\n\n###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** \nPlease cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.\n\n* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**\n* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)\n\n###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**\n\n* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: \n  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing &amp; ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.\n\n###8) **Reddiquette, Comments &amp; Subreddit Behavior:**\n\n* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.\n* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.\n* The definition of what truly is \"Oddly Satisfying\" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.\n\n###9) **Crossposts**\n* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma. \n\n#####Related subreddits:\n* /r/ArtisanVideos \n\n* /r/asmr \n\n* /r/clonedgif \n\n* /r/interestingasfuck \n\n* /r/knolling \n\n* /r/loadingicon \n\n* /r/lookscool \n\n* /r/mesmerizinggifs \n\n* /r/mildlyinfuriating \n\n* /r/mildlyinteresting \n\n* r/OrganizationPorn \n\n* /r/parasnailing \n\n* /r/perfectfit \n\n* /r/perfectLoops \n\n* /r/pic \n\n* /r/powerwashingporn \n\n* /r/satisfyinggrass\n\n* /r/showerthoughts \n\n* /r/simulated \n\n* /r/slightlyunsatisfying \n\n* /r/SlyGifs   \n\n* /r/ThatPeelingFeeling\n\n* /r/ThisBlewMyMind \n\n* /r/WtWFotMJaJtRAtCaB [SFW]","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"oddlysatisfying","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6NYespd3jy62IgAehgvHjNFg8z9zBIlFefIn2ZrF5oQ.png","title":"Oddly Satisfying","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#00a6a5","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/65GJujMgAXbydbxxFPYm6eck1YffqR-anhX4-hxnVhQ.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[115,120],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9221776,"submit_text_label":"Texty-text text","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/oddlysatisfying","key_color":"#ff66ac","name":"t5_2x93b","created":1368595528,"url":"/r/oddlysatisfying/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1368595528,"banner_size":[1280,384],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"For those little things that are inexplicably satisfying.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"WitchesVsPatriarchy","title":"Well","ups":46370,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/TmTtGtwA6SP4_NbHi5qCKs9TLcMg4zP2rX8qf6xyFBY.png","allowed_media_in_comments":["static"],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_p3r73/styles/communityIcon_jjw1w107bgl21.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c0b0cddc78538b6ff1ca71b3b00376f2e35af092","show_media":true,"description":"**r/WitchesVsPatriarchy** is a woman-centered sub with a witchy twist, aimed at healing, supporting, and uplifting one another through humor and magic. \n\nThe goal is to at once embrace, and poke fun at, the mystical aspects of femininity that have been previously demonized and/or devalued by the Patriarchy.\n\n**This subreddit is a Safe Space for Women, BIPOC, and anyone in the LGBTQ+ community.

Do not resort to name calling, or use condescending or patronizing language.  Racism, sexism or bigotry will not be tolerated.  Making inappropriate jokes with sexist or racist undertones is strictly prohibited. Violation of this rule may result in a ban\n\n2. **Posts must depict humans actually being bros.** Please do not post humans engaging in normal human behavior which might simply appeal to humans.\n\n3. **No reliance on additional context.**  The 'bro' action should be easily discernible within the image/gif/video. Having to add context in the title, comments, super-imposed text or otherwise to explain the 'bro' is against sub rules.  Submissions violating this rule will be removed\n\n4. **No reposts.** All reposts are removed at moderators discretion.  Repost farming is not allowed and will result in a ban.  Check the sub prior to posting to see if your submission has already been posted\n\n5.  **NSFW content.** NSFW content is sometimes okay here, but it must be flagged appropriately.  We do not allow any content related to suicide, or suicide prevention.  No rage bait submissions.  Any content that is sexually suggestive or contains drug use is grounds for a permanent ban\n\n6. **No Spam.** Original content and crossposts from other subreddits are welcome, but we do not allow posts promoting a specific website, YouTube channel, blog, subreddit etc. Such posts will be removed, reported as spam, and you will be banned. Creating a post for the sole purpose to redirect to another subreddit will be removed as spam\n\n7. **No staged submissions.** Scenes set up to look helpful are staged and will be removed.  Staged videos made by content creators for clout on TikTok, YouTube or Instagram will also be removed at moderators discretion.  No poverty porn or exploitative media.  We do not allow skits or social experiment videos.\n\n8. **No memes, comics, or compilations.** Refrain from posting jokes, memes, puns, reaction gifs and wordplays. No compilation videos, gifs, pictures, etc.\n\n9. **No Fundraising/Request/Donation Posts.** This includes any post or comment asking for people to perform a 'bro' action. Examples include: attending funerals, mailing cards, petitions, joining livestreams, and GoFundMe campaigns. Moderators will ban those violating this rule.\n\n10. **No spreading misinformation.** Sharing a source and debating that source or topic in a fair and reasonable manner (i.e., without personal attacks) is encouraged. Do not make wildly unsubstantiated and/or outlandish claims without the ability to share a source.\n\n11. **No posts or comments directly about politics and no bringing politics into a post or comment not about politics.  No war related content.  No posts centered around police**\n\n12.  **No text only submissions.** This includes screenshots of text messages, twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. Reddit screenshots from other communities will be reviewed on a case by case basis.  Images of text are prohibited.  This includes:  cards, letters, notes. \n\n13. **No slurs, harassing or trolling comments.  No racial slurs or sexually inappropriate comments. No hate speech.** This includes comments implying the animal in the image/gif is food, or will be eaten. Jokes about animals being food are not welcome.\nDo not post comments with a personal agenda or in an attempt to derail the thread or harass or troll other users.\n **Users violating this rule will be faced with a temporary or permanent ban**\n\n\n14.  **Comments that do not contribute to the discussion will be removed, and may face a temporary or permanent ban. Examples:**\n\n* this is fake \n* bet this was staged for likes/upvotes/clout \n* why did they have to film this?\n\n**Pot-stirring, trolling or bad-faith commentary about our content or its authenticity will not be allowed.** Discussion about the provenance and authenticity of submissions will be removed.\n\n\n**Evidence must be provided if you suspect a specific post is staged**\n \n\n# Moderators reserve the right to remove content they deem harmful to the sub.\n\n\n###### [The Being Network](https://www.reddit.com/user/pencer/m/thebeingnetwork)\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingJerks\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingBros\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingDerps\n\n&gt;r/KeanuBeingAwesome\n\n&gt;r/PeopleBeingJerks\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingConfused\n\n&gt;r/HumansBeingJerks\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingPolite\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingSleepy\n\n&gt;r/PlantsBeingJerks\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingFunny\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingAnimals\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingMoms\n\n&gt;r/AnimalsBeingSmart\n\n### Related Subs\n\n&gt; [The Being Network](http://www.reddit.com/user/pencer/m/thebeingnetwork) For all things being\n\n&gt;r/MadeMeSmile\n\n\n&gt;r/TodayIamHappy\n\n[](#/RES_SR_Config/NightModeCompatible)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"HumansBeingBros","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tXu_YNSw_DtYABgQLomfBeKyl1cGhe97pQYAYaE5Cig.png","title":"Humans just being bros","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/8rNZZcmVTZLAc_FEktfnShC5kmyT-Ie-1Fn_JenZL2U.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[50,50],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":4872204,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"right","display_name_prefixed":"r/HumansBeingBros","key_color":"#7e53c1","name":"t5_2xh58","created":1370546795,"url":"/r/HumansBeingBros/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1370546795,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"A place for sharing videos, gifs, and images of people being total bros.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"HolUp","title":"A very effective method indeed.","ups":40042,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":["giphy"],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_qir9n/styles/communityIcon_yvasg0bnblaa1.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dc31a794576fad4503de723a687478adbc00a8e7","show_media":true,"description":"Hol' up\r\n\r\n\r\n# Rules: \r\n\r\n1. **Be civil and don't be a jerk.** \r\nWe're a humor sub.
