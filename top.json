This is a happy place. Be respectful.\n\nComments or posts not in keeping with the tone of the sub will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nBullying, racism, homophobia and sexual comments in any form, comments or links, will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nIf the comment section gets too heated, it will get locked.\n\n###2. Audible and contagious laughing\n\nAll videos must contain contagious laughter.\n\nDo not post videos that are just funny because of a joke or a situation.\n\nAudience or edited in laughter does not count as contagious laughter.\n\nCompilations are mostly old and common reposts. Please refrain from posting them here.\n\nNo bullying or victimisation. No videos of people fighting or otherwise bad natured laughs.\n\n###3. Video length\n\nVideos must be at least 10 seconds long and have a good amount of laughing in them.\n\nIf the video is more than 1 minute long, please link directly to the specific moment when it is appropriate to start watching. Alternatively include the appropriate time code in the post title.\n\n###4. No reposts\n\nReposts may be removed to encourage fresh content.\n\nRemember to check top posts and search using keywords before you post.\n\nIt's also wise to check newest posts to see if someone has just posted the same viral video you are crossposting.\n\n###5. Post must have a proper title\n\nUse a descriptive title. Bad titles are hard to search and leads to more unnecessary reposts. Mods have the final word on what is considered a bad title.\n\nExamples of bad titles: \".\", \"title\", \"üòÇüòÇ\", \"funny title\", \"wait for it\", \"this made me laugh\"\n\n###6. No content promotion\n\nThis subreddit is not your personal marketing place. No spamming in general.\n\n###7. No politics\n\nPolitical videos and arguments are not allowed and will be removed. Let's keep this sub politics free.","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"ContagiousLaughter","header_img":null,"title":"Contagious Laughter","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":null,"primary_color":"","icon_img":"","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a new video","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":5880394,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/ContagiousLaughter","key_color":"#ddbd37","name":"t5_2u2bh","created":1336564914,"url":"/r/ContagiousLaughter/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1336564914,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Something to put you in a good mood.\n\nVideos of people laughing infectiously.

No homophobia/transphobia. No sexism/misogyny. No black fathers posts and similar mean-spirited things.\n \n5.) **Posts must be showcasing somebody being hilarious or insightful on social media**. No image macros, text conversations, or YouTube links. Just because somebody posted one of these on social media does not exempt it from this rule. Vines and such belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleVines/) and gifs belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackpeoplegifs).\n\n6.) Typical Reddit cliches such as **lyric chains**, **pun chains**, white-knighting, and low-effort joke comments will be removed.

Please search or look through BPT's older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts.\n\n8.) No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you think of something acceptable/reasonable. **Don't put the punchline in the title of the post**. Do not add \"bruh\", \"fam\", or similar vernacular to your post or comment.\n\n9.) Don't complain about [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) or slang. Use [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com) if you do not understand the meaning of a word. Comments asking \"what does x mean?\" will be removed. \n\n\n10.) BPT is an inclusive space for POC and allies alike.  This sub highlights minority viewpoints, through humor, commentary, or criticism.  Please respect these voices and show you care about black opinions as much as you care about black humor.\n \n11.) Don't post things from meme/corporate accounts.

Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n&gt; **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n&gt; **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n&gt; **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image.

No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting.

Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned.

Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.
