Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.\n\n* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).\n\n* **Compilation Albums/Videos**\n  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**\n  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).\n  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.\n\n* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.\n\n* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. \n\n###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** \nNSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (\"Say it, don't show it.\"). \n\n###3)  **Reposts:** \n**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown.

Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned.

No memes \n&gt; This includes references in titles of your post (e.g. \"banana for scale,\" \"potato quality\").\n\n----- \n\n&gt; ### 2. No related posts\n&gt; Posts that acknowledge, \"one-up,\" or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. \"I see your X and raise you Y\")\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###3. No x-posts or reposts\n&gt; Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.\n\n&gt; **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post. Posts deleted or removed from other subreddits are not exempt from rule 3. \n\n----- \n\n&gt; ###4. Original [OC] photographs only\n&gt; **a.** No gifs, videos, or websites.  \n\n&gt; **b.** All submissions must be original content. If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.  \n\n&gt; **c.** Software glitches/errors, overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed, although you may censor personal information per Reddit-wide rules.\n\n&gt; **d.** Side by side images are okay if they adhere to the rest of the rules.\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###5. No screenshots\n\n&gt; No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab. This means no images of screens, pictures of screens taken with a different device, images that have been partially or fully generated by a computer, or pictures of printed out screenshots. Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n&gt; **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n&gt; **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n&gt; **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image. (e.g. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), ;P, 😜, ❤, ★, ✿ )\n\n&gt; *Still confused?

No homophobia/transphobia. No sexism/misogyny. No black fathers posts and similar mean-spirited things.\n \n5.) **Posts must be showcasing somebody being hilarious or insightful on social media**. No image macros, text conversations, or YouTube links. Just because somebody posted one of these on social media does not exempt it from this rule. Vines and such belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleVines/) and gifs belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackpeoplegifs).\n\n6.) Typical Reddit cliches such as **lyric chains**, **pun chains**, white-knighting, and low-effort joke comments will be removed. Same for [annoying redditisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/8ezy45/an_update_for_some_of_the_rules_bad_faith/dxzhp13/), such as linking a subreddit as a reply to a post/comment.\n\n7.) **Reposts are highly discouraged, and if discovered will be removed**. Please search or look through BPT's older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts.\n\n8.) No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you think of something acceptable/reasonable. **Don't put the punchline in the title of the post**. Do not add \"bruh\", \"fam\", or similar vernacular to your post or comment.\n\n9.) Don't complain about [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) or slang. Use [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com) if you do not understand the meaning of a word. Comments asking \"what does x mean?\" will be removed. \n\n\n10.) BPT is an inclusive space for POC and allies alike.  This sub highlights minority viewpoints, through humor, commentary, or criticism.  Please respect these voices and show you care about black opinions as much as you care about black humor.\n \n11.) Don't post things from meme/corporate accounts.

No content involving people harming or harassing animals. Please do not submit sunrises, sunsets, or other content which does not have an element of 'wow-factor'. No posting of photoshopped or otherwise excessively and unnecessarily manipulated images.\n\n#####`2.` **Submission Titles**\n\n&gt; Every post title must begin with the fire emoji (🔥) and a space. The fire emoji defines this community. Your post will be automatically removed if you do not follow this rule.\n\n&gt;Titles should be accurate and descriptive: low effort titles will be removed. Include the animal/plant name, a location, and brief description to the best of your ability. Titles cannot say \"[Subject] is Lit\".\n\n#####`3.`  **Reposts**\n\n&gt;No posts that have been previously posted on this subreddit within 120 days (4 months) may be posted again. No posts that have previously been posted on this subreddit with over 10,000 upvotes in the past year may be posted again.\n\n&gt;Search the subreddit for key terms like the animal name before posting to check if your post is a repost. You can also use KarmaDecay and Google Reverse Image Search. Spamming many posts or excessive cross-posting in an attempt to karma farm will get you banned. \n\n#####`5.` **NSFW/L**  \n\n&gt;We do not allow NSFW content: bloody, gory and violent content can be redirected to our sister subreddit /r/natureismetal.\n\n\n#####`6.` **Human Concerns**  \n\n&gt; No politics, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, diet, or similar topics of human conceit.

These numbers are not high and don’t take long to achieve, but the exact numbers are hidden so karma farming bots can’t just meet them easily then come here.
