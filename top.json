All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you…\" or \"When they…\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed. Try /r/NSFWfunny. Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social media or electronic messaging content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed. This includes anything from Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, or any form of \"comments section\" on the Internet, as well as [content accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Images with SnapChat text added are allowed, as long as all UI elements have been removed. Please view [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules) for suggestions of where these submissions can be offered.|\n\n\nWant to see /r/funny with these posts?

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you…\" or \"When they…\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed. Try /r/NSFWfunny. Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social media or electronic messaging content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed. This includes anything from Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, or any form of \"comments section\" on the Internet, as well as [content accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Images with SnapChat text added are allowed, as long as all UI elements have been removed.

Simple as that. If you have a problem with our decision, [send us a message.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor)\n\n If you're trying to troll, your post will be immediately removed and your account will be banned. This includes tricks where you try to get someone to google something different than what they expect. \n\n 2B.  **A social media screenshot that is *solely* about one personality responding to another personality is not necessarily humor**, and might be better suited for subreddits such as /r/CleverComebacks or /r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter . Anything that can be described as a \"flame war, slapfight, clap-back, or sick burn\" or anything remotely similar is not appropriate for this subreddit.  It MUST contain humor to be allowed here.\n\n\n3. **Pictures of only text are not allowed.** \n\n    Pictures of text with no graphics will be removed. No, changing the color of the background is not a graphic. Screenshots of social media and satire websites are allowed. \n\n4. **Images &amp; short GIFs only.**\n\n    Linking to news articles, websites or videos is prohibited.\n\n    Gifs are allowed as long as they are no longer than 10 seconds and contain NO audio.  \n\n    Images must directly link to the content you're posting. Please use Reddit's image host or [imgur](https://imgur.com/) if you can.\n\n   Any other content, including META posts, videos, advertisements and blog posts will be removed. Any of this disallowed content hiding within \"allowed\" content may be met with further action at moderator discretion.\n\n  Any meta posts should be posted on our special [complaint forum](https://i.imgur.com/FOKLgfe.png). Don't post them here. \n\n5. **Avoid reposts, flooding, and spam.** \n\n Use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) or [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) and check /new and the front page before you post. Unfortunately, due to recent Reddit changes, karmadecay is not as effective, so we have a pretty light hand with repost violations and are not likely to ban you if you make a mistake. \n\n Do not post more than 4 posts in a 24 hour period.  \n\n6. **Be civil: No racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.** \n\n  The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team. \n\n  Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance. \n\n  If you're a jerk, including use of \"tard\" or anything related to a racial supremacist ideology, you'll be shown the door. \n\n  If you're intentionally trolling, including \"google games,\" you will be banned. \n\n7. **Do not brigade.** \n\n  Coming to this community en masse specifically to harass our users, or setting up a post or thread here referring to another subreddit or thread causes a lot of problems for everyone. If we suspect you're doing it, you will be banned. \n\n ___7b.___  **No \"Meta\" Posts.**\n\n Meta posts about this subreddit, or posts referencing any other subreddit are not allowed due to sitewide rules and brigading problems. This includes links to, or screen-shots of any other subreddit and or any other sub's comment section.\n\n\n8. **Follow Reddit's global rules.** Submissions failing to follow [Reddit's content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) will be removed. Basically, if you are trying to sell your T-Shirts or flip flops or sexbot site, or if you're a terrorist, you're gonna be booted. \n\n9. **No pointing at offsite resources**\n\n  Due to spam and foreign disinformation campaigns that have targeted Reddit in the past (including /r/PoliticalHumor in 2015-2016), we are banning any images that reference or bear the image of Facebook groups, other watermarks, or individual websites not ranked highly on Alexa Website Rankings.\n\n  This includes screenshots of dubious news sites, watermarks, and certain social media accounts posing as something they are not. This does NOT include political cartoons, screenshots of individual Twitter posts, or established satirical websites.\n\n###Enforcement Policy \n\n\n* **Moderators will enforce the rules at their sole discretion.** \n\n* You may ask for clarification of a removal by [messaging the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor) with a link to your post or comment. \n\n* To appeal a ban, respond to your original ban message.

If you can't respect that then please take a bus to Rock Bottom.\n\nSpecial thanks to u/BayonettaBasher!\n\n________________________________________\n---\n###THE RULES\n\n1. **All posts must be a Spongebob meme.** Do not post content just because it features a resident of Bikini Bottom. **Fan art and cosplays are allowed.**\nIf you want a sub catered to that sort of thing, check out r/Spongebob. As for here, *this is for memes and for memes only. We do not consider videos to be memes.*\n\n5. **ABSOLUTELY NO REPOSTS.** Posts must have not been posts *in this subreddit* before.\n[Use this nifty little tool to determine whether or not your post has already been here.](https://reverse.photos/)\n\n2. **Don't be a dick.**\nNo racism against squirrels. No hate speech. No posts about how different Pearl is from her father.\n\n3. **Do not put the punchline in the title of the post.**\n Having a funny picture of a Bikini Bottom resident and using the title as the punchline *does not make your post a meme.*\n\n4. **Do not post *really* low-effort memes.**\nUsing excessively overdone and/or outdated templates, posting something that is excruciatingly unfunny, begging for upvotes, *cake days posts*, posting something that simply doesn't make any sense... you get the idea.\n\n6. **No spamming.** More than 4 posts in 24 hours is considered spam.\n\n6. **The mods reserve the right to take any action (which includes banning users and removing comments) that they feel improves the overall quality of this subreddit.**\nOur most basic duty as mods is to keep this sub clean of any bullshit. With that in mind, we will do whatever we have to do in order to uphold that responsibility.
