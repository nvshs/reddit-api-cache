Hover below for more info, and check out our [wiki page](/r/mildlyinteresting/wiki)!**\n\n-----\n&gt; ### 1. No memes \n&gt; This includes references in titles of your post (e.g. \"banana for scale,\" \"potato quality\").\n\n----- \n\n&gt; ### 2. No related posts\n&gt; Posts that acknowledge, \"one-up,\" or relate specifically to another post are not allowed (e.g. \"I see your X and raise you Y\")\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###3. No x-posts or reposts\n&gt; Do not post something that has been submitted anywhere on reddit before (including here), even if you were the one who posted it.\n\n&gt; **Exception:** If a post is deleted or removed from /r/mildlyinteresting for breaking the rules less than one hour after being submitted or receives less than 100 upvotes, we allow the submitter to resubmit a fixed version of the post. Posts deleted or removed from other subreddits are not exempt from rule 3. \n\n----- \n\n&gt; ###4. Original [OC] photographs only\n&gt; **a.** No gifs, videos, or websites.  \n\n&gt; **b.** All submissions must be original content. If you didn't take the photo, don't post it.  \n\n&gt; **c.** Software glitches/errors, overlaid text, arrows, scribbles, and other substantive edits are not allowed, although you may censor personal information per Reddit-wide rules.\n\n&gt; **d.** Side by side images are okay if they adhere to the rest of the rules.\n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###5. No screenshots\n\n&gt; No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab. This means no images of screens, pictures of screens taken with a different device, images that have been partially or fully generated by a computer, or pictures of printed out screenshots. Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n&gt; **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n&gt; **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image. If your title leaves people surprised at the content within, it breaks the rule!\n\n&gt; **c.** Titles must not contain emoticons, emojis, or special characters unless they are absolutely necessary in describing the image. (e.g. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞), ;P, üòú, ‚ù§, ‚òÖ, ‚úø )\n\n&gt; *Still confused?

No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

Titles cannot say \"[Subject] is Lit\".\n\n#####`3.`  **Reposts**\n\n&gt;No posts that have been previously posted on this subreddit within 120 days (4 months) may be posted again. No posts that have previously been posted on this subreddit with over 10,000 upvotes in the past year may be posted again.\n\n&gt;Search the subreddit for key terms like the animal name before posting to check if your post is a repost. You can also use KarmaDecay and Google Reverse Image Search. Spamming many posts or excessive cross-posting in an attempt to karma farm will get you banned. \n\n#####`5.` **NSFW/L**  \n\n&gt;We do not allow NSFW content: bloody, gory and violent content can be redirected to our sister subreddit /r/natureismetal.\n\n\n#####`6.` **Human Concerns**  \n\n&gt; No politics, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, diet, or similar topics of human conceit. We are here for the awesomeness of nature. Any references to these topics will be removed.\n\n**REGARDING HIDDEN ACCOUNT AGE/KARMA THRESHOLD**\n\nWe hide the exact amounts to combat the rampant spam on this subreddit, this was the only way we found to significantly fight the spam/repost bot accounts. These numbers are not high and don‚Äôt take long to achieve, but the exact numbers are hidden so karma farming bots can‚Äôt just meet them easily then come here. Please do not send us a message to inquire about our karma rules. It's a question we do not and will not answer, nor do we override. Go out and build your numbers and try again in the future - we're not going anywhere :) \n\n##Please Visit Our Sister Subreddits:\n\nFor badass nature in all its gorey brutality, visit /r/natureismetal.\n\nFor cool extinct nature, check out /r/Naturewasmetal.\n\nFor people being badasses, visit /r/Humansaremetal.\n\nFor dead animals doing crazy things from the afterlife, check out /r/taxidermy and /r/taxidermyismetal.\n\n\n##[**User Flair**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/wiki/index#wiki_user_flairs)  \n##[**Subreddit Charities**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/wiki/charities)\n##[Moderator Feedback](/message/compose/?to=%2Fr%2FNatureIsFuckingLit&amp;subject=%2Fr%2FNatureIsFuckingLit%20Feedback)\n##[Moderators List](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/about/moderators)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"NatureIsFuckingLit","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tzrObEQglQISdgQA34GjDYEm1BwuX3cM32DHk4F2OeQ.png","title":"üî• Nature Is Fucking Lit","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#ffffff","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xNPwgp0SenX_J5sXRiGKNFLUa09-RxJlBp2mG2Gq5AU.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[45,45],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9815348,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/NatureIsFuckingLit","key_color":"#ff8717","name":"t5_3gdh7","created":1474215158,"url":"/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1474215158,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"We are here to appreciate the awesome majesty and incredibly cool aspects of nature. üî•","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"clevercomebacks","title":"Kennedy thought she was onto something there","ups":64098,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_dyqlw/styles/communityIcon_hu6arwy1hrq01.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=47811aa05f322a764aa1b3475a1d6f80b5440a01","show_media":true,"description":"The official sister sub of /r/MurderedByWords.

It takes both content and layout to make something a guide. The layout or structure of a guide must be that so, when someone is trying to find/reference information from the guide, they can do so logically or simply. If someone has to visually bop around your guide to find what they are looking for, the guide does not pass the layout test. On top of that not all guides are created equal, many technically qualify as guides, but lack substance. Guides are typically laid out in a grid configuration of some sort or sectioned into multiple tables by a category or step of a process. Flow charts and step-by-step guides are considered guides, so are visual references that line up different types of something next to one another other.\n\n**Defining An Infographic**\n\nAn infographic is more educational in layout and content, finding something specific on an infographic is not as easy because it is designed to inform through more narrative structures. If your guide is more of a visual essay than a structured table or list, then chances are that is an infographic. Sometimes infographics can masquerade as how-to guides. \n\n**Remembering That Sometimes It's Grey**\nThese are the considerations the mod team use when they feel it is appropriate to remove posts. If you have questions message us, if you think a post is not a good one downvote it.\n\n***Subreddit Rules***\n\n**1. Please only post direct links to images of type .png, .jpg, and .jpeg**\n\n**2. Infographics will be removed.**\n\n**3. Nonserious/Comedy Guides Will Be Removed (better suited for /r/shittycoolguides)**\n\n**4. Guides must use either Reddit or Imgur as an image host**\n\n**5. Guides depicting harmful, dangerous, or destructive content will be removed. This includes guides describing the creation of dangerous items/materials and/or guides that are designed with the purpose to harm or hurt others do not fit the culture of this sub and will be removed.** \n\nIf you know the source of your guide, post it in the comments so people can know the true heros!\n\nMany of you might have whole folders of guides, but they are all on similar topics. Please help keep the sub diverse by not saturating the sub with one topic. If you do we may remove some of your posts in the interest of keeping a wide array of topics.\n\n***Lastly, always check the comments for guides. Moderators are not experts in everything so we do not always moderate for accuracy, though there are often one or two people wearing their smarty pants in the comments.***","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"coolguides","header_img":null,"title":"Cool Guides","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":null,"primary_color":"","icon_img":"","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":3224405,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"","display_name_prefixed":"r/coolguides","key_color":"","name":"t5_310rm","created":1395333999,"url":"/r/coolguides/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1395333999,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Picture based reference guides for anything and everything.
