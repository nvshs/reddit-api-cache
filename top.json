All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you‚Ä¶\" or \"When they‚Ä¶\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators‚Äô discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no ‚ÄúCake Day‚Äù posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed. Try /r/NSFWfunny. Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social-media content (including Reddit), electronic messaging content, or AI-generated content.|Social-media content of any kind is not allowed. This include anything from any \"comments section,\" as well as [media accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Screenshots of electronic messages of any variety are not allowed. AI-generated content of any kind is forbidden.

No Reposts**\nMake sure you aren't submitting a post that has already been submitted. It's a good idea to browse our top 100 posts of all time to avoid making this mistake and to familiarize yourself with the subreddit. Frequent reposting may result in a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n**2. No Advertising**\nWhile you are allowed to post your own content on this subreddit (which MUST use the flair \"OC\"), do not post videos with the title advertising your TikTok page. This includes phrases such as \"follow me, like my TikTok, etc.\" No linking your TikTok page in comments unless it is under your own video. This will result in your post/comment being immediately deleted. Blatant advertisement trying to get views or followers for yourself/others will result in a permanent ban.\n\n**3. Flair Posts Correctly**\nAll posts must be marked and flaired correctly. This makes it easier for users to sort by flair to see the content they are looking for. If a moderator feels your post is not flaired correctly, the flair may be changed or the post may be removed.\n\n**4. All Original Content MUST be Flaired as Such**\nAlong with rule 3, all original content posted MUST use the ‚ÄúOC‚Äù flair. We would like our users to know if you created the video you posted. This also helps prevent self advertisement and spam. Users not following this rule should be reported immediately and will receive a one month ban.\n\n**5. Posts Must Be From TikTok**\nAll posts must be directly from TikTok. This means that you can clearly see the original creator's username as well as the TikTok logo in the corner of the video. Any video with the original poster's username cut out will not be considered a TikTok. Violation of this rule may result in a temporary ban.\n\n**6. No Posting of Personal Information**\nDo not post any personal information. This includes real names, phone numbers, addresses, etc. This may result in a permanent ban.\n\n**7. Don't Witch-hunt**\nDo not call for the heads of anyone displayed in anything posted here. This will result in an immediate and permanent ban.\n\n**8. No Being Deliberately Rude, Vulgar, or Offensive to Others in Comments**\nDo not go out of your way to put down other members of the community in the comment section of a post. This may result in a permanent ban. If you see someone breaking this rule, simply report them and move on. No need to respond and get yourself banned as well.\n\n**9. Hate Speech**\nThere will be zero tolerance for explicit racism, homophobia/transphobia, or sexism/misogyny. Engaging in any sort of hate speech will result in the post or comment being removed and you will receive a permanent ban.\n\n**10. No Bad-Faith Posts Featuring Anyone Who is Mentally Ill or Disabled**\nNo content is allowed that focuses on people who are mentally ill or disabled. This will result in an immediate and permanent ban.\n\n**11. No Compilations/YouTube Video Re-uploads**\nThis is not a place to post compilations. Posting compilations may result in a permanent ban.\n\nUploading videos that are clearly YouTube videos (SNL skits, Video game highlights, etc) are not allowed. Even if you found it on TikTok, do not post ripped unedited YouTube video-TikToks here. This may result in a temporary ban.\n\n**12. Don't Complain About the Subreddit Name**\nThe subreddit evolved long ago last it's roots of \"only cringe-worthy\" content. There have been two community polls where over 85% of users agreed to include all content. It's come to the point where users who say \"This isn't cringe\" or anything of that sort, may receive a temporary ban. We have made this clear enough with a pinned comment on every single post.\n\n**13. All Political Posts MUST be Flaired as Such**\nAll political posts must be flaired as \"politics.\" Failure to do so will result in a temporary ban.\n\n**14. No spamming/irrelevant gif replies**\nBecause we are apart of reddit's POWERUPS program, users are able to reply to posts/comments with gifs. Anyone seen spamming or posting gifs completely irrelevant to the post or comment in question will receive a temporary ban.","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"TikTokCringe","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PkhK2qIsp9RQlT-dqKqjDY4k6k40k_fi_pjqqH7b5NQ.png","title":"The Best and Worst of TikTok","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":null,"primary_color":"#b33bd8","icon_img":"","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a TikTok Video","header_size":[91,100],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":1704724,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/TikTokCringe","key_color":"#7e53c1","name":"t5_mvcq5","created":1533622973,"url":"/r/TikTokCringe/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1533622973,"banner_size":[1280,384],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"A place to watch the best and worst videos from TikTok.\n\nHere you can find TikToks that are cringe-worthy, funny, wholesome, and more!

Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned.

Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.
