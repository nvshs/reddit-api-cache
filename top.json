No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned.

If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned.

No [Bad Faith Participation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/wiki/bfp).\n \n3.) No bullying or witch-hunting. This includes comments disparaging people whose tweets and posts are featured here. Doxxing or sharing personal information will result in a permanent ban. \n \n4.) **No Racism**. No hate speech. No homophobia/transphobia. No sexism/misogyny. No black fathers posts and similar mean-spirited things.\n \n5.) **Posts must be showcasing somebody being hilarious or insightful on social media**. No image macros, text conversations, or YouTube links. Just because somebody posted one of these on social media does not exempt it from this rule. Vines and such belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleVines/) and gifs belong [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/blackpeoplegifs).\n\n6.) Typical Reddit cliches such as **lyric chains**, **pun chains**, white-knighting, and low-effort joke comments will be removed. Same for [annoying redditisms](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/8ezy45/an_update_for_some_of_the_rules_bad_faith/dxzhp13/), such as linking a subreddit as a reply to a post/comment.\n\n7.) **Reposts are highly discouraged, and if discovered will be removed**. Please search or look through BPT's older posts to see if your content has already been posted. KarmaDecay is not a reliable tool to check for reposts.\n\n8.) No posts with terrible titles, they will be removed. You are free to re-submit once you think of something acceptable/reasonable. **Don't put the punchline in the title of the post**. Do not add \"bruh\", \"fam\", or similar vernacular to your post or comment.\n\n9.) Don't complain about [AAVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English) or slang. Use [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com) if you do not understand the meaning of a word. Comments asking \"what does x mean?\" will be removed. \n\n\n10.) BPT is an inclusive space for POC and allies alike.  This sub highlights minority viewpoints, through humor, commentary, or criticism.  Please respect these voices and show you care about black opinions as much as you care about black humor.\n \n11.) Don't post things from meme/corporate accounts. Posts must come from regular social media accounts.  \n\n12.) **The moderators of this subreddit will take any action (which includes banning and removing comments) that they feel improves the quality of the subreddit.**\n\n---\n\n---\n\n‚òëÔ∏è**Friends**‚òëÔ∏è\n\n* /r/BPTmeta\n\n* /r/blackpeoplegifs \n\n* /r/wholesomebpt\n\n* /r/memesofanime\n\n* /r/bestoftwitter\n\n* /r/WhitePeopleFacebook \n\n* /r/indianpeoplefacebook\n\n* /r/oldpeoplefacebook\n\n* /r/blackpeoplevines\n\n* /r/bptcirclejerk\n\n* /r/LatinoPeopleTwitter\n\n* /r/BikiniBottomTwitter \n\n* /r/NSFWTwitterReplies\n\n* /r/saiyanpeopletwitter","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"BlackPeopleTwitter","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/sT2axkkgWgb6V5rO35En_dRy6FUwCosDH0FQtoWa_EA.png","title":"Black Twitter","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#ffffff","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/goztKoS6PTNQClaez3bF9leosspey2xXCOv0DSxNG2Q.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[100,109],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":5637123,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/BlackPeopleTwitter","key_color":"#24a0ed","name":"t5_33x33","created":1412734504,"url":"/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1412734504,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Screenshots of Black people being hilarious or insightful on social media, it doesn't need to just be twitter but obviously that is best.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"worldnews","title":"Zelenskyy calls on world leaders to react to video of murder of Ukrainian prisoner of war","ups":61386,"post_hint":"link","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":[],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2qh13/styles/communityIcon_pldiwqvsyns91.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3088f291b089bb5bc15599d429a759b258c6cbd5","show_media":false,"description":"&gt;&gt;&gt; - **Other Subs:**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; - [Related](http://goo.gl/ztbbza)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/News\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/PoliticalDiscussion\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/WorldEvents\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/GeoPolitics\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/IntheNews\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/GlobalTalk \n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/Breakingnews \n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/Business\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/Economics\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/Environment\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/History\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/HumanRights\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/Features\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/UpliftingNews\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/NewsOfTheWeird\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/FakeNews\n&gt;&gt;&gt;     - /r/ID_News \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; - [N.

Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned.

We have cookies and UNLIMITED POWER!\n\n###[discord](https://discord.gg/msnKMcPq2p)\n\n*****\n\nDid you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It‚Äôs not a story the Jedi would tell you. It‚Äôs a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life‚Ä¶ He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful‚Ä¶ the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.\n*****\n*****\n\n\n##Rules:\n\n##1. No metagaming\n\n##2. Don't be an asshole\n\n##3. Posts must be memes of the Star Wars Prequels.\n\n##4. Posts inappropriate for viewing in public, like at work, must be tagged NSFW.\n\n##5. No politics.\n\n##6. No edgy or inflammatory posts.\n\n##7. No brigading/encouraging brigading.\n\n##8. No encouraging subreddit drama.\n\n##9. No annoying bots or novelty accounts\n\n##10. No short-term reposts\n\n##11. No low-effort posts\n\n##12. No promotion\n\n##13. No misinformation\n\n##14. No spam\n\n*****\n\n##Details: \n\n1\\. No upvote/karma/awards/subscriber related posts. These have become spammy and unoriginal, and give actual, original content less of a chance of being noticed. These posts will be removed. Posts that ask for karma/upvotes, also known as vote manipulation, will result in a post removal and a ban. Cakeday posts also fall under this rule.\n\n2\\. No threatening or harassing other users, celebrities, YouTube channels, pet hamsters, etc. This includes being aggressive or impolite to other users, most likely from some sort of disagreement. We do not care who ‚Äústarted it‚Äù when a pair of users are acting this way. Just report someone if they are acting that way and we will handle it.\n\n3\\. Posts must be, at least loosely, related to star wars prequels. \"Prequel\" refers to any media that takes place before the beginning of A New Hope. This includes new movies made post-Lucas, EU content, and video games. Note that single pictures of a character (e.g. \"Just a picture of Obi-Wan\") do not necessarily count as memes, and may be seen as a violation of Rule 1. Additionally, all posts must make an attempt at humor. All posts must be made *from* prequel-content or *about* prequel content.\n\n4\\. Pornographic material is strictly forbidden on this subreddit as it is not an 18+ sub. NSFW posts are simply posts you might not show your grandmother. NSFW posts that are not porn should be marked as NSFW. Kids come here, use your head. If you wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with a 12 year old on their iPad seeing your content, best to mark it NSFW to be safe. In addition to this, do not sexualize minors on this sub. Including that notorious copypasta.\n\n5\\. Obi-Wan is not brave enough for politics, nor are we. /r/PrequelMemes is meant to be a refuge from the extreme political divisiveness you see on nearly every Reddit community every day. Even if an issue seems black and white to you, it is not to be discussed on the subreddit. As a result, we don't allow anything that would bring politics in. Politics is a sweeping term that includes international politics, non-political posts related to politicians, or anything else that is at all related to real life politics or social-issues.\n\n6\\. No edgy/inflammatory posts. We have the moral high ground. This subreddit is not the place to joke about distasteful content that would offend a large percentage of the user base. This includes those edgy memes that involve autism or school shootings. /r/PrequelMemes is about humor for everyone involved. If your humor is derived from upsetting/mocking others, probably not a good community for you. With that said, we do not simply remove every meme that someone might disagree with.\n\n7\\. Brigading, in reddit terms, is the encouragement of mass downvoting and invading of another subreddit. This is forbidden by Reddit's TOS, and, likewise, our rules. Brigading includes linking to subreddits and telling people to downvote their content. This also extends to things outside of reddit, like polls, videos, etc. Basically anything that constitutes a call to action. Brigading coordinated from /r/PrequelMemes or in the name of /r/PrequelMemes is subject to any repercussions on this sub.\n\n8\\. Do not encourage or incite subreddit drama. This includes trying to start ‚Äúmeme wars‚Äù, trashtalking other subreddits, and encouraging others to start a war. Keep in mind that wars can only be started by the subreddit moderators, and has to be mutually agreed to by the other subreddit‚Äôs mods. Very similar to rules 6 and 7, but also applies internally to causing drama in /r/PrequelMemes. Causing drama could include being intentionally aggressive to other users, baiting users into breaking rules, etc.\n\n9\\. No accounts, bot or novelty, that spam the sub or otherwise only occupy space on the sub without offering any actual merit. If your bot gets banned and you are willing to change it to meet our requirements, use mod mail to find out what needs to be changed.\n\n10\\. Here are the requirements for reposts:\n\n* Posts must be at least 6 months old before you can repost them\n\n* It also must be 6 months since the last time it was posted \n\n* All reposts must be flaired to indicate as such\n\n* OP must provide the source of the original in the comments\n\n11\\. This one is pretty simple. Post good memes that will make people laugh. Give it a good title. For the title, if you can't think of anything, slap on a loosely-related prequel quote and you are golden. Also, don‚Äôt put the caption in the title; the post must be a meme on its own if it didn‚Äôt have the title. This rule also prohibits screenshots. This includes text conversations showing someone's reaction to a meme and pictures of polls with the ‚ÄúI love democracy‚Äù macro slapped below it.\n\n12\\. Do not do anything that constitutes advertising or promoting anything not officially associated with the subreddit. This includes posting links to them, giving instructions on how to find them, etc. This rule generally prohibits store pages, Youtube channels, Instagram accounts, other subreddits, and discord servers, although [there are exceptions](https://old.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/wiki/rules#wiki_exceptions11)\n\n13\\. Do not convey rumors in a way that would lead people to believe they are factual. Do not spread information you know to be false. If something might not be true, make that clear in your post. This includes anything from leaks to unofficial sources of information.\n\n14\\. I cannot believe we need to make this a rule. It should be obvious. Do not post the same thing multiple times. Do not post a comment multiple times. Do not promote scams.\n\n[See the full rules, complete with examples, exceptions, and consequences, for more details.](https://old.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/wiki/rules)\n\n*****\n\nOther Star Wars Meme subs:\n\n \n\n /r/SequelMemes - /r/OTMemes - /r/The_Valkorion - /r/AnthologyMemes - /r/KOTORMemes\n\nOther Star Wars Sub Affiliations\n\n/r/StarWarsSpeculation\n\n******\nCSS by /u/Illummix\n******\nWant to use spicy emotes on this sub?

This is a happy place. Be respectful.\n\nComments or posts not in keeping with the tone of the sub will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nBullying, racism, homophobia and sexual comments in any form, comments or links, will be removed and users may be banned.\n\nIf the comment section gets too heated, it will get locked.\n\n###2. Audible and contagious laughing\n\nAll videos must contain contagious laughter.\n\nDo not post videos that are just funny because of a joke or a situation.\n\nAudience or edited in laughter does not count as contagious laughter.\n\nCompilations are mostly old and common reposts. Please refrain from posting them here.\n\nNo bullying or victimisation. No videos of people fighting or otherwise bad natured laughs.\n\n###3. Video length\n\nVideos must be at least 10 seconds long and have a good amount of laughing in them.\n\nIf the video is more than 1 minute long, please link directly to the specific moment when it is appropriate to start watching. Alternatively include the appropriate time code in the post title.\n\n###4. No reposts\n\nReposts may be removed to encourage fresh content.\n\nRemember to check top posts and search using keywords before you post.\n\nIt's also wise to check newest posts to see if someone has just posted the same viral video you are crossposting.\n\n###5. Post must have a proper title\n\nUse a descriptive title. Bad titles are hard to search and leads to more unnecessary reposts. Mods have the final word on what is considered a bad title.\n\nExamples of bad titles: \".\", \"title\", \"üòÇüòÇ\", \"funny title\", \"wait for it\", \"this made me laugh\"\n\n###6. No content promotion\n\nThis subreddit is not your personal marketing place. No spamming in general.\n\n###7. No politics\n\nPolitical videos and arguments are not allowed and will be removed. Let's keep this sub politics free.","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"ContagiousLaughter","header_img":null,"title":"Contagious Laughter","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-aRiAKQyfxSEA8u0R1bBaiIaeXH0xBsJvGkNnKwTpiE.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"Submit a new video","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":6309765,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/ContagiousLaughter","key_color":"#ddbd37","name":"t5_2u2bh","created":1336564914,"url":"/r/ContagiousLaughter/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1336564914,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Something to put you in a good mood.\n\nVideos of people laughing infectiously.
