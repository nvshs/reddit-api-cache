Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

Simple as that. If you have a problem with our decision, [send us a message.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor)\n\n If you're trying to troll, your post will be immediately removed and your account will be banned. This includes tricks where you try to get someone to google something different than what they expect. \n\n 2B.  **A social media screenshot that is *solely* about one personality responding to another personality is not necessarily humor**, and might be better suited for subreddits such as /r/CleverComebacks or /r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter . Anything that can be described as a \"flame war, slapfight, clap-back, or sick burn\" or anything remotely similar is not appropriate for this subreddit.  It MUST contain humor to be allowed here.\n\n\n3. **Pictures of only text are not allowed.** \n\n    Pictures of text with no graphics will be removed. No, changing the color of the background is not a graphic. Screenshots of social media and satire websites are allowed. \n\n4. **Images &amp; short GIFs only.**\n\n    Linking to news articles, websites or videos is prohibited.\n\n    Gifs are allowed as long as they are no longer than 10 seconds and contain NO audio.  \n\n    Images must directly link to the content you're posting. Please use Reddit's image host or [imgur](https://imgur.com/) if you can.\n\n   Any other content, including META posts, videos, advertisements and blog posts will be removed. Any of this disallowed content hiding within \"allowed\" content may be met with further action at moderator discretion.\n\n  Any meta posts should be posted on our special [complaint forum](https://i.imgur.com/FOKLgfe.png). Don't post them here. \n\n5. **Avoid reposts, flooding, and spam.** \n\n Use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) or [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) and check /new and the front page before you post. Unfortunately, due to recent Reddit changes, karmadecay is not as effective, so we have a pretty light hand with repost violations and are not likely to ban you if you make a mistake. \n\n Do not post more than 4 posts in a 24 hour period.  \n\n6. **Be civil: No racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.** \n\n  The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team. \n\n  Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance. \n\n  If you're a jerk, including use of \"tard\" or anything related to a racial supremacist ideology, you'll be shown the door. \n\n  If you're intentionally trolling, including \"google games,\" you will be banned. \n\n7. **Do not brigade.** \n\n  Coming to this community en masse specifically to harass our users, or setting up a post or thread here referring to another subreddit or thread causes a lot of problems for everyone. If we suspect you're doing it, you will be banned. \n\n ___7b.___  **No \"Meta\" Posts.**\n\n Meta posts about this subreddit, or posts referencing any other subreddit are not allowed due to sitewide rules and brigading problems. This includes links to, or screen-shots of any other subreddit and or any other sub's comment section.\n\n\n8. **Follow Reddit's global rules.** Submissions failing to follow [Reddit's content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) will be removed. Basically, if you are trying to sell your T-Shirts or flip flops or sexbot site, or if you're a terrorist, you're gonna be booted. \n\n9. **No pointing at offsite resources**\n\n  Due to spam and foreign disinformation campaigns that have targeted Reddit in the past (including /r/PoliticalHumor in 2015-2016), we are banning any images that reference or bear the image of Facebook groups, other watermarks, or individual websites not ranked highly on Alexa Website Rankings.\n\n  This includes screenshots of dubious news sites, watermarks, and certain social media accounts posing as something they are not. This does NOT include political cartoons, screenshots of individual Twitter posts, or established satirical websites.\n\n###Enforcement Policy \n\n\n* **Moderators will enforce the rules at their sole discretion.** \n\n* You may ask for clarification of a removal by [messaging the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor) with a link to your post or comment. \n\n* To appeal a ban, respond to your original ban message. We will politely tell you to go away if you fail to do this. \n\n\n* Users who are polite and understanding will be unbanned.  \n\n* If you want to go higher up the chain for a complaint on how we moderate our subreddit, please fill out [this form](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/)\n\n###Related Political Subreddits\n\n* /r/Politics: What do art majors think of this issue? \n\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes: What do high schoolers think of this issue?\n\n* /r/BlackPeopleTwitter: The biggest libertarian sub on Reddit\n\n* /r/WhitePeopleTwitter: Asians can post here too\n\n* /r/LatinoPeopleTwitter: They use the word \"puto\" like weeboos use the word \"baka\"\n\n* /r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter: Don't you know that Twitter subreddits are supposed to be racially segregated?\n\n* /r/CleverComebacks: AKA /r/Twitter\n\n* /r/Technology: If we nerd it up enough, we can pretend we're not political. \n\n* /r/WorldNews: Nationalist Thunderdome\n\n* /r/Europe:  Americans pay about as much attention to this as they do to Eurovision\n\n* /r/UKPolitics: r/UKPolitics: Politics, in English. \n\n* /r/Canada: A moose once bit my sister\n\n* /r/JoeBiden: You can see his teeth from a mile away but you really gotta watch for his hands\n\n* /r/Conservative: Libertarian since January 20th, 2021!\n\n* /r/Libertarian: They hate regulation so much they can't even regulate what \"libertarian\" means  \n\n* /r/libertarianmeme: I do what I want - Ron\n\n* /r/RandomActsOfMuting: Literally nothing to do with politics\n\n* /r/Socialism: Every user is also a moderator.

The show ran from 2005-2013 but is still watched just as much today. Join us as we discuss the show!\n\n\n---\n\n#####Discord Server\n\nr/DunderMifflin now has a Discord Server. [Click here to join](https://discord.gg/dundermifflin) and discuss the show!\n\n---\n#####Rules\n\n####1) Be Civil\n\nDon't ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going, or where you've been, ever, for any reason whatsoever. \n\n####2) No spam/Low-effort posts\n\nKeep posts directly related to TV show \"The Office\". Low effort posts will be removed, [for examples and more info, click here](https://redd.it/95w3xk). Memes/images from social media will also likely be removed as they're 99% reposts.\n\n####3) No piracy\n\nDon't link to or request episodes hosted illegally online. This includes streams, torrents, cloud-hosted files, etc.\n\n####4) No politics\n\nNo posts related to politics. They always result in uncivil discussion and aren't welcome here. This includes posts mentioning/comparing something or someone from the show to a political figure, or anything you saw at a protest/strike/rally.\n\n####5) No cake-day posts/asking for karma\n\nCake day posts are forbidden unless they are high-effort OC. \n\n####6) Image hosting\n\nImages, GIFs, and Webms to be hosted on Reddit, Imgur, gfycat, or giphy only.\n\n####7) Self-Promotion\n\nThe promotion of products or services whose sale benefits you, either directly or indirectly, is forbidden.\n\n####8) No Merchandise\nPosts that are about items of merchandise (\"look at this cool shirt\", \"I found this board game\", \"I made Cards Against The Office\") are prohibited without prior mod approval.\n\n####9) No New Spoilers\nActors from The Office may feature in new media and franchises. Though it may be tempting to discuss their new roles, feeling like this is a safe community to do so: it isn't. This subreddit is for The Office only. If you make a post or comment that spoils new content (within reason, like for a major franchise) in other \"cinematic universes\", the post will be removed, and you may receive a ban.\n\n[Learn your rules](https://i.redd.it/w9drnp65p5b11.gif)\n\n#####Guidelines:\n\n####Reposts\n\nPlease do not repost. Frequent reposts will be removed, please search the sub before posting.\n\nRecent reposts will also be removed. If you're posting a recent tweet/article/headline, it's probably already been submitted.\n\n####Stay relevant\n\nMake sure your whole post is relevant to the show, not just the title or image. If you have to give it a The Office title to make it relevant, it's not worth posting.\n\n####Is your post low effort?\n\nThe following types of posts are low effort and will be removed:\n\n* Pictures of your TV screen (especially \"are you still watching\" netflix screens)\n* Photos of small wall-mounted TV screens\n* AI-generated scripts, scenes, quotes, etc.\n* Actors in other TV shows\n* IRL sightings of names related to the show.\n* George Foreman grills\n* Photos of Randall Park (Asian Jim) making a joke about how it's actually Jim\n* Screenshots of the show with nothing else added to them\n* Any post with an especially shitty title\n\n[More examples here of low effort posts](https://redd.it/95w3xk)\n\n####Unexpectedoffice\n\nScreenshots of Reddit/social media comments referencing the show should be posted to /r/unexpectedoffice instead.\n\n#### Bots\nBots and novelty accounts, as determined by the mods in their sole discretion, are subject to arbitrary bans.\n\n---\n\n#####Related subreddits\n\n* /r/unexpectedoffice\n\n* /r/Schruteprotips\n\n* /r/creedthoughts\n\n* /r/tobyistheworst\n\n* /r/TelevisionQuotes\n\n* /r/SnapChatTheOffice \n\n#####The Office Resouces\n\n* [The Office on Wiki](http://bit.ly/n3spL)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"DunderMifflin","header_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/UEbDxGpaWu_Hcv-NkrNXN-_g_72BnCD5mzF9Tyek000.png","title":"People Person's Paper People","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#646d73","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/FYJbhGbso3_cPY5qS3s6WqkwqXrTL65ty2RRzx8TmcU.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[177,82],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":2112798,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/DunderMifflin","key_color":"#a5a4a4","name":"t5_2s9h3","created":1294463810,"url":"/r/DunderMifflin/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1294463810,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Why waste time watch many show when one show do trick?","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"WorkReform","title":"Tax Them.
