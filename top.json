This can be physical (like popping bubble wrap), visual (a perfectly looped GIF), or even aural (the crunching of leaves).\n####What does \"Oddly Satisfying\" mean?\nWe are forever searching for a \"true definition\". It's a *thing* that fits *your* interpretation of what *is* \"oddly satisfying\" plus the inexplicable feeling we all know.\n\n***Subjective. Indefinable. Completely recognizable.* It's a wonderful feeling.**\n\n######Rules:\n**Please report rule-violating posts and comments by messaging the moderators with a link to the post in question. This helps us remove them more promptly.**\n###1)  **Banned Topics:**\nWe have a number of banned topics. Please do not submit any of the following:\n\n* **Memes or image macros**\n\n* **Number posts** Posts centered around number patterns, or round numbers. This includes Reddit karma, Facebook likes, calendars, gas prices, odometers, receipts, screenshots of the games such as \"2048\", etc. You can, however, submit these to /r/OddlySatisPi_ing.\n\n* **Violence** Any content portraying violence is prohibited and will be removed. Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.\n\n* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).\n\n* **Compilation Albums/Videos**\n  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**\n  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).\n  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.\n\n* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.  Any posts linking to a YouTube video will be removed.\n\n* **Products:** Posts and any sort of content about products will be removed. \n\n###2)  **NSFW/NSFL posts/comments:** \nNSFW/NSFL links or images are not allowed. NSFW text posts and comments are allowed (\"Say it, don't show it.\"). \n\n###3)  **Reposts:** \n**Frequent or common reposts, or reposts from the past 2 months and highly upvoted may be removed.** When you report posts, please include a link to the original version of the post. Please help keep this subreddit *satisfyingly* fresh by not intentionally reposting content that has already circulated regardless of when. If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.\n\n* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.\n\n* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as \"My...\", \"Mine...\", \"Our...\", \"We...\", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.\n\n###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** \nPlease cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.\n\n* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged. Submissions *must include [OC] in the title*.  Reserve links to social media accounts for the comments section if possible (see Rule #7). A great example may be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/4t9otw/cutting_yarn/d5flul0). **Please do not spam our subreddit or reddit in general. Please read the [reddit wiki on self-promotion] (https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) to avoid being reported to the admins.**\n* Works by artists, graphic designs and logos are encouraged. Content must keep within the overall subreddit theme and not violate Rule #7. Permitted examples may be found [here](https://redd.it/4g0749), [here](https://redd.it/1ofwdf), and [here](http://imgur.com/lRStrIz)\n\n###7)  **Spam Accounts/Links/Submissions:**\n\n* **[No spamming whatsoever.](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)** Violation of this rule *may* result in a permanent ban. Such violations include: \n  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing &amp; ad-heavy sites. Trolling in any capacity. Any content which may be interpreted as spam or ad-revenue generation not elsewhere mentioned.\n\n###8) **Reddiquette, Comments &amp; Subreddit Behavior:**\n\n* Please abide by proper [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) at all times.\n* Please keep the comments section civil and friendly. General cursing/foul language are allowed.\n* The definition of what truly is \"Oddly Satisfying\" is subjective and unique to each user. Please respect their definition.\n\n###9) **Crossposts**\n* x-posting from other subs is encouraged by reddit admins. Under no circumstances should a user's post be considered in violation of this subreddit's rules unless they are in actuality in violation of a rule. i.e. don't report a user just because they have a large amount of karma. \n\n#####Related subreddits:\n* /r/ArtisanVideos \n\n* /r/asmr \n\n* /r/clonedgif \n\n* /r/interestingasfuck \n\n* /r/knolling \n\n* /r/loadingicon \n\n* /r/lookscool \n\n* /r/mesmerizinggifs \n\n* /r/mildlyinfuriating \n\n* /r/mildlyinteresting \n\n* r/OrganizationPorn \n\n* /r/parasnailing \n\n* /r/perfectfit \n\n* /r/perfectLoops \n\n* /r/pic \n\n* /r/powerwashingporn \n\n* /r/satisfyinggrass\n\n* /r/showerthoughts \n\n* /r/simulated \n\n* /r/slightlyunsatisfying \n\n* /r/SlyGifs   \n\n* /r/ThatPeelingFeeling\n\n* /r/ThisBlewMyMind \n\n* /r/WtWFotMJaJtRAtCaB [SFW]","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"oddlysatisfying","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6NYespd3jy62IgAehgvHjNFg8z9zBIlFefIn2ZrF5oQ.png","title":"Oddly Satisfying","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#00a6a5","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/65GJujMgAXbydbxxFPYm6eck1YffqR-anhX4-hxnVhQ.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[115,120],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9322737,"submit_text_label":"Texty-text text","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/oddlysatisfying","key_color":"#ff66ac","name":"t5_2x93b","created":1368595528,"url":"/r/oddlysatisfying/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1368595528,"banner_size":[1280,384],"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"For those little things that are inexplicably satisfying.","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"MadeMeSmile","title":"I’m u/miraclman31 the guy that recovered from locked in syndrome.

Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but “factoid” text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned.

If your title is ill-defined your post may be removed. For example posting CGI content without the mention of it being CGI will result in a removal.\n\n#Avoid Common Reposts\nPosts that have been posted recently to /r/nextfuckinglevel should not be posted repeatedly. If a post has done well on the sub within the past few months it should not be posted again.\n\n#Be Respectful to Others\nTreat others in the subreddit politely and do not troll or harass anyone. This includes slurs and hate speech, which will prompt a ban. We welcome positivity above all.\n\n#Avoid Spam\nDo not post multiple times to this subreddit in a short amount of time. Repeated spam will be moderated.\n\n#Link directly to the content\nYour post (gifs, videos) must be directly linked to the content.

Simple as that. If you have a problem with our decision, [send us a message.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor)\n\n If you're trying to troll, your post will be immediately removed and your account will be banned. This includes tricks where you try to get someone to google something different than what they expect. \n\n 2B.  **A social media screenshot that is *solely* about one personality responding to another personality is not necessarily humor**, and might be better suited for subreddits such as /r/CleverComebacks or /r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter . Anything that can be described as a \"flame war, slapfight, clap-back, or sick burn\" or anything remotely similar is not appropriate for this subreddit.  It MUST contain humor to be allowed here.\n\n\n3. **Pictures of only text are not allowed.** \n\n    Pictures of text with no graphics will be removed. No, changing the color of the background is not a graphic. Screenshots of social media and satire websites are allowed. \n\n4. **Images &amp; short GIFs only.**\n\n    Linking to news articles, websites or videos is prohibited.\n\n    Gifs are allowed as long as they are no longer than 10 seconds and contain NO audio.  \n\n    Images must directly link to the content you're posting. Please use Reddit's image host or [imgur](https://imgur.com/) if you can.\n\n   Any other content, including META posts, videos, advertisements and blog posts will be removed. Any of this disallowed content hiding within \"allowed\" content may be met with further action at moderator discretion.\n\n  Any meta posts should be posted on our special [complaint forum](https://i.imgur.com/FOKLgfe.png). Don't post them here. \n\n5. **Avoid reposts, flooding, and spam.** \n\n Use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) or [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) and check /new and the front page before you post. Unfortunately, due to recent Reddit changes, karmadecay is not as effective, so we have a pretty light hand with repost violations and are not likely to ban you if you make a mistake. \n\n Do not post more than 4 posts in a 24 hour period.  \n\n6. **Be civil: No racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.** \n\n  The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team. \n\n  Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance. \n\n  If you're a jerk, including use of \"tard\" or anything related to a racial supremacist ideology, you'll be shown the door. \n\n  If you're intentionally trolling, including \"google games,\" you will be banned. \n\n7. **Do not brigade.** \n\n  Coming to this community en masse specifically to harass our users, or setting up a post or thread here referring to another subreddit or thread causes a lot of problems for everyone. If we suspect you're doing it, you will be banned. \n\n ___7b.___  **No \"Meta\" Posts.**\n\n Meta posts about this subreddit, or posts referencing any other subreddit are not allowed due to sitewide rules and brigading problems. This includes links to, or screen-shots of any other subreddit and or any other sub's comment section.\n\n\n8. **Follow Reddit's global rules.** Submissions failing to follow [Reddit's content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) will be removed. Basically, if you are trying to sell your T-Shirts or flip flops or sexbot site, or if you're a terrorist, you're gonna be booted. \n\n9. **No pointing at offsite resources**\n\n  Due to spam and foreign disinformation campaigns that have targeted Reddit in the past (including /r/PoliticalHumor in 2015-2016), we are banning any images that reference or bear the image of Facebook groups, other watermarks, or individual websites not ranked highly on Alexa Website Rankings.\n\n  This includes screenshots of dubious news sites, watermarks, and certain social media accounts posing as something they are not. This does NOT include political cartoons, screenshots of individual Twitter posts, or established satirical websites.\n\n###Enforcement Policy \n\n\n* **Moderators will enforce the rules at their sole discretion.** \n\n* You may ask for clarification of a removal by [messaging the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor) with a link to your post or comment. \n\n* To appeal a ban, respond to your original ban message. We will politely tell you to go away if you fail to do this. \n\n\n* Users who are polite and understanding will be unbanned.  \n\n* If you want to go higher up the chain for a complaint on how we moderate our subreddit, please fill out [this form](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/)\n\n###Related Political Subreddits\n\n* /r/Politics: What do art majors think of this issue? \n\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes: What do high schoolers think of this issue?\n\n* /r/BlackPeopleTwitter: The biggest libertarian sub on Reddit\n\n* /r/WhitePeopleTwitter: Asians can post here too\n\n* /r/LatinoPeopleTwitter: They use the word \"puto\" like weeboos use the word \"baka\"\n\n* /r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter: Don't you know that Twitter subreddits are supposed to be racially segregated?\n\n* /r/CleverComebacks: AKA /r/Twitter\n\n* /r/Technology: If we nerd it up enough, we can pretend we're not political. \n\n* /r/WorldNews: Nationalist Thunderdome\n\n* /r/Europe:  Americans pay about as much attention to this as they do to Eurovision\n\n* /r/UKPolitics: r/UKPolitics: Politics, in English. \n\n* /r/Canada: A moose once bit my sister\n\n* /r/JoeBiden: You can see his teeth from a mile away but you really gotta watch for his hands\n\n* /r/Conservative: Libertarian since January 20th, 2021!\n\n* /r/Libertarian: They hate regulation so much they can't even regulate what \"libertarian\" means  \n\n* /r/libertarianmeme: I do what I want - Ron\n\n* /r/RandomActsOfMuting: Literally nothing to do with politics\n\n* /r/Socialism: Every user is also a moderator.
