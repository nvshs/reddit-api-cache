Violation(s) of this rule will result in a ban.\n\n* **Off-topic Content:** Any content determined off-topic to and/or submitted for purposes other than the overall theme of the subreddit will be removed. An unfortunate example may be found [here](https://redd.it/4t786s).\n\n* **Compilation Albums/Videos**\n  * No compilation videos of any variety. **Violations *will* result in a permanent ban.**\n  * The entirety of compilation albums must be a continuation of, or remain central to, the first image of said album (E.g., separate gifs of a Rube Goldberg machine or a catalog of one artist's work).\n  * Albums must not contain any images in violation of Rule #3.\n\n* **YouTube Links:**  We are not allowing any YouTube links due to the increase in spam and off topic content stemming from them.

If it appears you are intentionally reposting old content repeatedly, we may resort to limiting your posting privileges.\n\n\n###4)  **Content Removal/Privilege Revocation:** \nMods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary, if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others.\n\n###5)  **Submission Titles:**\n\n* The title of each submission must describe the content shown. Any user should know the contents of a link before clicking.\n\n* Clickbait-esque titles are not allowed.\n\n* Titles claiming possession, original content, event participation, etc. (such as \"My...\", \"Mine...\", \"Our...\", \"We...\", etc.) in which another's original work/content may be mistaken as OP's will be removed.\n\n###6) **[OC]/Source Citation:** \nPlease cite the source of submitted content, particularly fine-art submissions.\n\n* Original Content by artists, musicians, etc. is encouraged.

Such violations include: \n  * Links to clickbait-esque sites (e.g. Buzzfeed), suspicious domains, social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.), etc. Off-topic content (political, crowd-funding, etc.). ***Repetitive submissions to Youtube channels, social media accounts, webpages, blogs, newsletters, etc.*** Advertisements, marketing &amp; ad-heavy sites.

No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you…\" or \"When they…\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7. No gore, pornography, or animal cruelty.|Gore, pornography, and sexually-graphic images are not allowed. Try /r/NSFWfunny. Animal cruelty is strictly forbidden. All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social media or electronic messaging content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed. This includes anything from Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, or any form of \"comments section\" on the Internet, as well as [content accompanied by text from those platforms](https://i.imgur.com/LJ5ZeU6.png). Images with SnapChat text added are allowed, as long as all UI elements have been removed.

Don't be a jerk.  This subreddit is /r/MadeMeSmile, and it's curated as such. We do not tolerate personal attacks, hate speech, harassment, racism, sexism, or other jerk-like behavior (includes gatekeeping posts).  [SEE MORE HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/mademesmile/wiki/rule1)\n\n2.  No ragebait posts.  No posts where someone's misfortune makes you smile.  e.g. \"terrorists driving off a cliff\" or \"murderer gets what he deserves\".  This isn't a ragebait sub.\n\n3.  No social media account surnames.  If we can see the last name of a person visible in your screenshot, it'll get removed. (exception is a twitter checkmark)\n\n4.  Posting more than 4 times in a day is considered spam.  Posting 4 times a day 3 days in a row is considered spam.  Don't flood the subreddit please.\n\n  Please post \"Winning\" posts on Wednesdays only. This is just to reduce the amount of spam and fake posts we get on the subreddit. Any \"Winning\" posts that are submitted outside of Wednesday will be removed.\n-------------------------------------------------------\nParticipation in hatereddits may lead to an immediate, non-appealable ban.\n________________________________________\n[**Click here for a full list of nice subreddits**](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/wiki/related-sub-suggestions) or try one of these:  \n\n\n \n/r/UpliftingNews  \n/r/RandomKindness  \n/r/kitten  \n/r/MMFB  \n/r/ContagiousLaughter  \n/r/baww  \n/r/HumansBeingBros  \n/r/wholesomememes  \n/r/wholesomegifs  \n/r/DogisMyCopilot  \n/r/HappyCowGifs  \n/r/PupliftingNews  \n  \nLogo credit: [The_Art_God](http://www.reddit.com/user/The_Art_God)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"MadeMeSmile","header_img":"https://e.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gPmIRa9hJtOT7u4L.png","title":"MadeMeSmile","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/6LXqqT3C0TSzXMKj6t23XDks2cCy8_kuLZ8Gs2129rU.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[195,66],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":7416626,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/MadeMeSmile","key_color":"#0079d3","name":"t5_2uqcm","created":1344621277,"url":"/r/MadeMeSmile/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1344621277,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"A place to share things that made you smile or brightened up your day.

Simple as that. If you have a problem with our decision, [send us a message.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor)\n\n If you're trying to troll, your post will be immediately removed and your account will be banned. This includes tricks where you try to get someone to google something different than what they expect. \n\n 2B.  **A social media screenshot that is *solely* about one personality responding to another personality is not necessarily humor**, and might be better suited for subreddits such as /r/CleverComebacks or /r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter . Anything that can be described as a \"flame war, slapfight, clap-back, or sick burn\" or anything remotely similar is not appropriate for this subreddit.  It MUST contain humor to be allowed here.\n\n\n3. **Pictures of only text are not allowed.** \n\n    Pictures of text with no graphics will be removed. No, changing the color of the background is not a graphic. Screenshots of social media and satire websites are allowed. \n\n4. **Images &amp; short GIFs only.**\n\n    Linking to news articles, websites or videos is prohibited.\n\n    Gifs are allowed as long as they are no longer than 10 seconds and contain NO audio.  \n\n    Images must directly link to the content you're posting. Please use Reddit's image host or [imgur](https://imgur.com/) if you can.\n\n   Any other content, including META posts, videos, advertisements and blog posts will be removed. Any of this disallowed content hiding within \"allowed\" content may be met with further action at moderator discretion.\n\n  Any meta posts should be posted on our special [complaint forum](https://i.imgur.com/FOKLgfe.png). Don't post them here. \n\n5. **Avoid reposts, flooding, and spam.** \n\n Use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) or [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) and check /new and the front page before you post. Unfortunately, due to recent Reddit changes, karmadecay is not as effective, so we have a pretty light hand with repost violations and are not likely to ban you if you make a mistake. \n\n Do not post more than 4 posts in a 24 hour period.  \n\n6. **Be civil: No racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.** \n\n  The fact that we have to explicitly state that racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc; including personal attacks, and threats of violence are all uncivil terrifies the mod team. \n\n  Anything disparaging something about a person that they have little or no control over, is not tolerated under any circumstance. \n\n  If you're a jerk, including use of \"tard\" or anything related to a racial supremacist ideology, you'll be shown the door. \n\n  If you're intentionally trolling, including \"google games,\" you will be banned. \n\n7. **Do not brigade.** \n\n  Coming to this community en masse specifically to harass our users, or setting up a post or thread here referring to another subreddit or thread causes a lot of problems for everyone. If we suspect you're doing it, you will be banned. \n\n ___7b.___  **No \"Meta\" Posts.**\n\n Meta posts about this subreddit, or posts referencing any other subreddit are not allowed due to sitewide rules and brigading problems. This includes links to, or screen-shots of any other subreddit and or any other sub's comment section.\n\n\n8. **Follow Reddit's global rules.** Submissions failing to follow [Reddit's content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) will be removed. Basically, if you are trying to sell your T-Shirts or flip flops or sexbot site, or if you're a terrorist, you're gonna be booted. \n\n9. **No pointing at offsite resources**\n\n  Due to spam and foreign disinformation campaigns that have targeted Reddit in the past (including /r/PoliticalHumor in 2015-2016), we are banning any images that reference or bear the image of Facebook groups, other watermarks, or individual websites not ranked highly on Alexa Website Rankings.\n\n  This includes screenshots of dubious news sites, watermarks, and certain social media accounts posing as something they are not. This does NOT include political cartoons, screenshots of individual Twitter posts, or established satirical websites.\n\n###Enforcement Policy \n\n\n* **Moderators will enforce the rules at their sole discretion.** \n\n* You may ask for clarification of a removal by [messaging the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPoliticalHumor) with a link to your post or comment. \n\n* To appeal a ban, respond to your original ban message. We will politely tell you to go away if you fail to do this. \n\n\n* Users who are polite and understanding will be unbanned.  \n\n* If you want to go higher up the chain for a complaint on how we moderate our subreddit, please fill out [this form](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/)\n\n###Related Political Subreddits\n\n* /r/Politics: What do art majors think of this issue? \n\n* /r/PoliticalCompassMemes: What do high schoolers think of this issue?\n\n* /r/BlackPeopleTwitter: The biggest libertarian sub on Reddit\n\n* /r/WhitePeopleTwitter: Asians can post here too\n\n* /r/LatinoPeopleTwitter: They use the word \"puto\" like weeboos use the word \"baka\"\n\n* /r/PoliticsPeopleTwitter: Don't you know that Twitter subreddits are supposed to be racially segregated?\n\n* /r/CleverComebacks: AKA /r/Twitter\n\n* /r/Technology: If we nerd it up enough, we can pretend we're not political. \n\n* /r/WorldNews: Nationalist Thunderdome\n\n* /r/Europe:  Americans pay about as much attention to this as they do to Eurovision\n\n* /r/UKPolitics: r/UKPolitics: Politics, in English. \n\n* /r/Canada: A moose once bit my sister\n\n* /r/JoeBiden: You can see his teeth from a mile away but you really gotta watch for his hands\n\n* /r/Conservative: Libertarian since January 20th, 2021!\n\n* /r/Libertarian: They hate regulation so much they can't even regulate what \"libertarian\" means  \n\n* /r/libertarianmeme: I do what I want - Ron\n\n* /r/RandomActsOfMuting: Literally nothing to do with politics\n\n* /r/Socialism: Every user is also a moderator.
