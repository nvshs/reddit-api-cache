Posts must be IAF| No screenshots, unneeded sound on gifs/videos, memes, funny things, edgyness, cuteness, porn, click bait, etc., no AI-generated images, illusions, most arts/crafts, conceptual things that are not actuality, architecture, low-effort links to wikipedia articles. No content that's only interesting to you. No content that just belongs on /r/historyporn, /r/mildlyinteresting or other subs - must still be mind-blowingly interesting. No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned. No shitposting/joke posts. Shitpost = instant ban|\n|4. No gossip or tabloid-esque material|This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No \"talking head\" videos. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site|\n|5. If needed, include a source|If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the title, or in the comment section. Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed. Labels on a chart or graphic are allowed, but ‚Äúfactoid‚Äù text is not. No tiktok videos with annoying text/emoji/music. Subtitles are OK.|\n|8. Reposts| Reposts are allowed. HOWEVER, if something has been posted a lot it's going to be removed. Use the search function before posting. If your reposts become an annoyance to the mods, you will be banned. If reporting a repost, provide links.|\n----\n#**Other things to note:**\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* Please don't complain if you think something isn't interesting.\n\n* Users are encouraged to contribute to the subreddit, please try to treat others how you would like to be treated.\n\n* If you feel something violates the rules report it.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam.

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you‚Ä¶\" or \"When they‚Ä¶\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators‚Äô discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no ‚ÄúCake Day‚Äù posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules).

All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed.

[Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social media or electronic messaging content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed.

In March 2018, shortly after the Malindo Air flight departed from Kuala Lumpur, the 20 year old started watching pornography on his laptop. As no one seemed to notice or call him out for it, the man began taking his clothes off. At the request of the cabin crew, the student put his clothes back on. But soon, he tried to hug female flight attendants.\n\n\n###**VIII. Really, seriously, don‚Äôt be a cunt**\n\n1. That whole ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be a cunt‚Äù thing, just don‚Äôt\n\n\n###**IX.

No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you‚Ä¶\" or \"When they‚Ä¶\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators‚Äô discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no ‚ÄúCake Day‚Äù posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules). Low-effort titles, memetic titles, titles which circumvent other rules, and titles comprising excessive or disruptive emojis are similarly disallowed. |\n|7.

All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed.

[Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10.

If you are feeling suicidal [we have some resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/wiki/suicideprevention) to guide you to people who help.\n\n**Don't post NSFW**, or openly sexual. Even if you tag it.\n\n**Avoid screenshots that are mostly text**, and feel contrived and performative. Show don't tell!\n\n**Don't make posts that request upvotes** or any other kind of reddit metric (gold, comments, etc.). That age of me irl is over.\n\n[**ABOUT US, AND THE FULL RULZ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/wiki/index)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ncheck out the me irl family!\n\n**\\/r\\/me_irl** - selfies of the soul\n**/r/meow_irl** - for the kitty in u\n**/r/woof_irl** - for the puppy in u\n**/r/metal_me_irl** - slaughter of the soul\n**/r/me_irl_neue** - anything is everyone  \n//  \n**/r/woofbarkwoof** - dog!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[advent calendar](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/7m3jnw/meirl)\n\n[zoobooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/2zrvz8/me_irl/)\n\n[snAck!](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/3ftjwm/me_irl/)\n\n[date while you wait](http://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/3axfro/me_irl/)\n\n[you the man](http://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/39hmtq/me_irl/)\n\n[he boot too big](http://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/30g144/me_irl/) \n\n[not sure if](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/3dj828/me_irl/)\n\n[pumpkin spice doggo](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/3qaydj/me_irl/)\n\n[\"get paid pupper\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/472aui/meirl/)\n\n[stormymade.tumblr.com](http://stormymade.tumblr.com/)\n\n[cool pupper](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/4fs3jw/me_irl/)\n\n[cathy brennan is a fake goth](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/4ggeqh/meirl/)\n\n[Do it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/4huv1i/me_irl/)\n\n[üêò](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/4r01re/me_irl/)\n\n[announcement: pupper](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/4vrl0m/meirl/)\n\n[ÁÅ´Ëªä](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/4we2g8/%E7%81%AB%E8%BB%8A/)\n\n[When the meme is very good, haha yes](https://twitter.com/kokosac/status/756699861991514112)\n\n[new autumnal doggo](http://i.imgur.com/K0ezjiV.jpg)\n\n[happy fall of the bourgeoisie](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/55f5fp/meirl/)\n\n[jazz is my life](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/58408d/meirl/)\n\n[fellow americans, it's going to be okay. we're going to fight and defend our rights. you're strong, brave, and we're powerful together. ‚ù§](http://i.imgur.com/mjYQOoj.jpg)\n\n[it them](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/5byfgg/me_irl/)\n\n[admins irl](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/5frv2m/admins_irl/)\n\n[This Christmas, give your family the gift of LEGO](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/5gunkz/this_christmas_give_your_family_the_gift_of_lego/)\n\n[the new meme for 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/5ldutt/the_new_meme_for_2017/)\n\n[69 days until spring! üå∏ üå∫ üåª üå∑](https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/5n5p77/69_days_until_spring/)\n\n[The Wendy's social media manager gets a living wage and health insurance.
