All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you…\" or \"When they…\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5.

No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules).

All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed. This includes pictures of text with images that don't add necessary context, transcriptions of standup comedy (as with /r/standupshots), and screenshots of jokes. [Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social media or electronic messaging content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed.

No screenshots\n\n&gt; No screenshots. We define a screenshot as a screen grab. This means no images of screens, pictures of screens taken with a different device, images that have been partially or fully generated by a computer, or pictures of printed out screenshots. Try /r/screenshots!. \n\n-----\n\n&gt; ###6. Titles must be an exact but concise description of the content\n&gt; **a.** Titles must not contain jokes, backstory, or other fluff. That information belongs in a follow-up comment.  \n\n&gt; **b.** Titles must exactly describe the content. It should act as a \"spoiler\" for the image.

All posts must make an attempt at humor.|Humor is subjective, but all posts must at least make an attempt at humor. Posts which are intentionally disruptive, inane, or nonsensical will be removed. [Read more here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules)|\n|2. No memes, HIFW, MRW, MeIRL, DAE, or similar posts.|If your submission begins with \"When you…\" or \"When they…\" or anything of a similar nature, it is not allowed here. Submissions depicting or containing intentionally emulated behaviors (memes) are also not allowed, including memetic image macros, \"challenges,\" or elements thereof. HIFW, MRW, TFW, MeIRL, demotivationals, eCards, and DAE posts are similarly disallowed.  Non-meme image macros are allowed.\n|3. No reposts.|Reposts will be removed at the moderators’ discretion. Serial reposters will be banned. Please use [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) to determine if something has been submitted before.|\n|4. No personal info, hate-speech, or harassment.|No identifying information, including anything hosted on platforms making that information public. Posts encouraging the harassment of any individual, group, community, or subreddit will be removed, and the submitting user may be banned. If necessary, a report will be made to the site administration. In accordance with [Reddit's policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), there is zero tolerance for this.|\n|5. No politics or political figures.|Anything involving politics or a political figure (regardless of context) will be removed. Try /r/politicalhumor instead.|\n|6. No forbidden titles, low-effort titles, or posts about Reddit cakedays. (See below).|No asking for upvotes (in any form), no “Cake Day” posts, and no posts to communicate with another Redditor. Posts with titles such as \"I got banned from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" or \"This got removed from \\/r/\\_\\_\\_\" are not allowed. For an inclusive list, [please read the complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules).

All other NSFW content must be tagged as such.|\n|8. No unoriginal comics.|Comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays (measured using Pacific Time), and only by their original artists.|\n|9. No pictures of just text.|Image-based submissions in which the humor can be conveyed via text alone are not allowed.

[Here are some examples](https://i.imgur.com/HS1fCC5.png). Text posts using Reddit's native system are allowed.|\n|10. No social media or electronic messaging content (including Reddit).|Social media content of any kind is not allowed.

No pics of [just a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ij26vk/rules_of_the_subreddit_if_these_are_broken_your/)|\n|2. Titles| Describe the content of the post/why it's interesting (it can be a bit humorous too). Avoid just copying titles blindly when reposting from other subs. \"This &lt;thing&gt;\" is not an adequate title. Posts solely consisting of an interesting title, with just a boring picture is not allowed. No clickbait titles, follow-up titles. Titles should be descriptive enough to be searchable (search for reposts)|\n|3. No spam|Spammers don't read the rules but it's still against the rules. No product or website marketing/shilling (dropshippers), blog/personal website promotion. Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget or YOU could be banned.

Claims about biggest/highest needs proof. Don't claim ownership of something you didn't create. No false/misleading information. Credible sources only - no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy, please provide background info for further reading for interesting things|\n|6. Be civil|We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk. Please report offenders.|\n|7. No text on an image/gif/video| Text on an image/gif/video that could have been put in the title is not allowed.

Don’t violate Reddit's Content Policy**\n1. Pretty simple. Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, incite violence, etc. Find the content policy [here] (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). If you disagree with this, take it up with the admins, because we have no say in them.\n\n\n###**II. Don't be a cunt**\n\n1. Also simple. If you come to this sub to be a cunt and to argue about politics, religion, etc in an uncivil way, then you will be banned. This is a shitposting sub dammit, not r/politics.\n\n\n###**III. Shitposts 😃 God awful posts 😡**\n\n1. This subreddit is for shitposts, not gawdawfulposts. and yes, repost chains/blatant karmawhoring posts are godawfulposts, not shitposts. Posting literal shit=ban. [Due to the poll addressing user complaints](https://redd.it/piumy6) the following are now being removed: unoriginal comment baiting posts (AMA, start arguing, ask questions and edit) and CUM spam. \n\n\n###**IV. Mod discretion**\n\n1. Mods have final say on what content stays or goes. Pursuant to Comb. Civ. C. §22SA{g}{i} We reserve the right to ban users for making our subreddit terrible\n\n\n###**V. Kevin**\n\n1. Kevin\n\n\n###**VI. No excessive spamming**\n\n1. Pretty easy. Don't spam posts or comments. We are a shitposting sub, but we have *some*, miniscule, standards.\n\n\n###**VII. Number 7**\n\n1. A Bangledeshi 20 year old student was arrested after watching porn, stripping naked and attacking an attendant during a flight. In March 2018, shortly after the Malindo Air flight departed from Kuala Lumpur, the 20 year old started watching pornography on his laptop. As no one seemed to notice or call him out for it, the man began taking his clothes off. At the request of the cabin crew, the student put his clothes back on. But soon, he tried to hug female flight attendants.\n\n\n###**VIII. Really, seriously, don’t be a cunt**\n\n1. That whole “don’t be a cunt” thing, just don’t\n\n\n###**IX. Properly mark NSFW and spoilers**\n\n1. im at work 😡what if my boss sees boobies on my screen 🤬. \"idk if it's nsfw/a spoiler or not\" then just mark it anyways.\n\n\n###**X. Videos must not exceed 1-ish minutes**\n\n1. This is to prevent overly long videos that become a bore to have to look at.\n\n\n^Hover ^over ^the ^rules ^to ^view ^them.\n\n---\n\n#####[Reddetiquette](https://reddit.com/wiki/reddetiquette)\n\n\n[](https://discord.gg/bvNZRuKxWk)\n---","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"shitposting","header_img":null,"title":"shitposting","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#b8001f","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gR3vPt3PqLBCCsbqGWUZIaSbYiUoLGh8wUZPyvxli1c.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"This button is called Rory.","header_size":null,"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":true,"subscribers":2235257,"submit_text_label":"Say hello to Kevin","link_flair_position":"right","display_name_prefixed":"r/shitposting","key_color":"","name":"t5_2usxq","created":1345364538,"url":"/r/shitposting/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1345364538,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Be Funny","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":true,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"comics","title":"Teachers Strike","ups":47791,"post_hint":"image","media":null,"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"","allowed_media_in_comments":["giphy","static","animated"],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":false,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2qh0s/styles/communityIcon_d0dg7ue8x5881.png?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d70a2d18530f5c0a662cb8f5acb3ab5cd64b1cf6","show_media":true,"description":"##About \\/r/Comics\n\n&gt; This subreddit is for everything related to print comics and web comics.  Artists are encouraged to post their own work.  News and media for adaptations based on comic books are welcome. Read [the subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/wiki/index) for more information about the subreddit.\n\n\n##[General Conduct](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_general_conduct)\n\n&gt; 1. **[Don't complain about comics you don't like or understand.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_1._don.27t_complain_about_comics_you_don.27t_like.)** - If you don't get a comic, it's probably not meant for you. Comics are often targeted at certain audiences. If you don't get a comic, odds are it wasn't meant for you. Don't whine about it; just move on to the next comic.\n2. **[Don't attack artists posting their content.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_2._don.27t_attack_artists_posting_their_content)** - It's not ok to attack artists with hateful comments meant to tear them down or try to chase them off Reddit. \n3. **[Don't make drama for drama's sake. No trolling.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_3._don.27t_make_drama_for_drama.27s_sake._no_trolling.)** - Anyone wanting to participate in this community needs to keep their comments civil.  No hateful comments or posts - Any comments or posts that are racist, mysogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, misinformation or extremist in nature will be removed and will result in an immediate ban.\n4. **[Respect the [OC] System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_4._respect_the_.5Boc.5D_system)** - The [OC] tag is for artists wanting to submit their Original Content.  False claims on others' art will get you banned.\n5. **[Respect the Report System](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_5._respect_the_report_system)** - Reports are for content that breaks this sub's/Reddit's rules.  False reports are given to the Reddit Admins. \n6. **[Tag NSFW content when needed.](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_6._tag_nsfw_content_when_needed.)** - Content with nudity, pornography, or obvious profanity should be tagged as NSFW.  \n\n##[What is OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_ok_to_post)\n\n&gt; * **Comic covers or short excerpts** - *A few* scanned pages can be posted for discussion.  Don't post entire comic books.  Posts with too many pages will get removed.\n* **Web comic strips** - Most strips need to be linked back to original sources (i.e. the artists' websites).   Don't link to [rehosted](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_rehosting) or [hotlinked](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_hotlinking) comics. Artists can use [OC] to link to their own work anywhere.\n* **Links to articles, videos, art, cosplay or music** - Content directly related to comic books or web comics, including film and TV media.  \n* **Discussion topics** - Talk about past or present comic books or strips.  Topics about comic-based movies or TV shows are also fine.\n* **Translations** - English translations of non-English original comics are ok as long as the translation is honest and a link to the original source is provided in a comment.\n\n##[What is not OK to Post](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_not_ok_to_post)\n\n&gt; * **Edits to comics that you didn't make** - Don't remove watermarks/attribution or try to \"fix\" someone else's work.  Post your own original content.\n* **Stuff that just reminds you of comics without there being any real reference in the topic** - Please keep posts on topic with real comic content.\n* **Links to download complete, pirated comic books** - Please support comics by buying them.\n\n\n##[Are You A Comic Artist?](/r/Comics/wiki/index#wiki_are_you_a_comic_artist.3F)\n\n&gt; Content creators can get Artist Flair to display next to their account names on all of their posts. [Message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FComics) with some proof and the name of your strip for some blue flair.  Artists without flair can add [OC] to post titles to identify their \"Original Content.\" Tagging a post with [OC] allows links to general hosting sites like Imgur.\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp;\n    \n&gt; [ ](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23comics \"flair-talk\")\n\n##Related Subreddits\n\n&gt; * /r/comicbooks\n* /r/webcomics\n* /r/manga\n* /r/graphicnovels\n* /r/comicbookart\n* /r/comiccon\n* /r/comic_crits\n* /r/wholesomecomics \n* /r/webtoons \n* /r/comicbookshelves.\n* [Marvel Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/marvel)\n* [DC Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/dc)\n* [Image Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/image)\n* [Vertigo Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/vertigo)\n* [Dark Horse Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/darkhorse)\n* [Valiant Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/valiant)\n* [Manga Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/manga)\n* [Other Comics-Related Subreddits](/r/comics/wiki/other)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"comics","header_img":"https://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/uIbyX8MSVa0J6mKV.png","title":"Print Comics and Webcomics ","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":null,"primary_color":"","icon_img":"","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[175,40],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":2128893,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/comics","key_color":"#0079d3","name":"t5_2qh0s","created":1201219852,"url":"/r/comics/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1201219852,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"Everything related to print comics (comic books, graphic novels, and strips) and web comics.

No content involving people harming or harassing animals. Please do not submit sunrises, sunsets, or other content which does not have an element of 'wow-factor'. No posting of photoshopped or otherwise excessively and unnecessarily manipulated images.\n\n#####`2.` **Submission Titles**\n\n&gt; Every post title must begin with the fire emoji (🔥) and a space. The fire emoji defines this community. Your post will be automatically removed if you do not follow this rule.\n\n&gt;Titles should be accurate and descriptive: low effort titles will be removed. Include the animal/plant name, a location, and brief description to the best of your ability. Titles cannot say \"[Subject] is Lit\".\n\n#####`3.`  **Reposts**\n\n&gt;No posts that have been previously posted on this subreddit within 120 days (4 months) may be posted again. No posts that have previously been posted on this subreddit with over 10,000 upvotes in the past year may be posted again.\n\n&gt;Search the subreddit for key terms like the animal name before posting to check if your post is a repost. You can also use KarmaDecay and Google Reverse Image Search. Spamming many posts or excessive cross-posting in an attempt to karma farm will get you banned. \n\n#####`5.` **NSFW/L**  \n\n&gt;We do not allow NSFW content: bloody, gory and violent content can be redirected to our sister subreddit /r/natureismetal.\n\n\n#####`6.` **Human Concerns**  \n\n&gt; No politics, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, diet, or similar topics of human conceit. We are here for the awesomeness of nature. Any references to these topics will be removed.\n\n**REGARDING HIDDEN ACCOUNT AGE/KARMA THRESHOLD**\n\nWe hide the exact amounts to combat the rampant spam on this subreddit, this was the only way we found to significantly fight the spam/repost bot accounts. These numbers are not high and don’t take long to achieve, but the exact numbers are hidden so karma farming bots can’t just meet them easily then come here. Please do not send us a message to inquire about our karma rules. It's a question we do not and will not answer, nor do we override. Go out and build your numbers and try again in the future - we're not going anywhere :) \n\n##Please Visit Our Sister Subreddits:\n\nFor badass nature in all its gorey brutality, visit /r/natureismetal.\n\nFor cool extinct nature, check out /r/Naturewasmetal.\n\nFor people being badasses, visit /r/Humansaremetal.\n\nFor dead animals doing crazy things from the afterlife, check out /r/taxidermy and /r/taxidermyismetal.\n\n\n##[**User Flair**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/wiki/index#wiki_user_flairs)  \n##[**Subreddit Charities**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/wiki/charities)\n##[Moderator Feedback](/message/compose/?to=%2Fr%2FNatureIsFuckingLit&amp;subject=%2Fr%2FNatureIsFuckingLit%20Feedback)\n##[Moderators List](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/about/moderators)","user_is_muted":null,"display_name":"NatureIsFuckingLit","header_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/tzrObEQglQISdgQA34GjDYEm1BwuX3cM32DHk4F2OeQ.png","title":"🔥 Nature Is Fucking Lit","previous_names":[],"user_is_moderator":null,"over_18":false,"icon_size":[256,256],"primary_color":"#ffffff","icon_img":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/xNPwgp0SenX_J5sXRiGKNFLUa09-RxJlBp2mG2Gq5AU.png","icon_color":"","is_chat_post_feature_enabled":true,"submit_link_label":"","header_size":[45,45],"restrict_posting":true,"restrict_commenting":false,"subscribers":9809199,"submit_text_label":"","link_flair_position":"left","display_name_prefixed":"r/NatureIsFuckingLit","key_color":"#ff8717","name":"t5_3gdh7","created":1474215158,"url":"/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/","quarantine":false,"created_utc":1474215158,"banner_size":null,"allow_chat_post_creation":false,"user_is_contributor":null,"accept_followers":true,"public_description":"We are here to appreciate the awesome majesty and incredibly cool aspects of nature. 🔥","link_flair_enabled":true,"disable_contributor_requests":false,"subreddit_type":"public","user_is_subscriber":null}},{"subreddit":"aww","title":"Welcome home","ups":42719,"post_hint":"hosted:video","media":{"reddit_video":{"bitrate_kbps":2400,"fallback_url":"https://v.redd.it/xu160dmqvpoa1/DASH_720.mp4?source=fallback","height":720,"width":456,"scrubber_media_url":"https://v.redd.it/xu160dmqvpoa1/DASH_96.mp4","dash_url":"https://v.redd.it/xu160dmqvpoa1/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1681866055%2CMDI0ZGFhMzZiYjY1NzkwODAxMWMzNWQzZmQ5NGNmNmUxYjI4YWExYjU0M2NlMDI4ODQyOTdhOGY1OGYwYmZhMw%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","duration":12,"hls_url":"https://v.redd.it/xu160dmqvpoa1/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1681866055%2CZjYyN2QyMzY2NDFhMmVjYzAyNmU5YWYwNjU2MTZhZDJiNjZlZDU4NThlODJkNmQ4ZDI3Yjk0ZWY0MTA2ZjhhNA%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd","is_gif":false,"transcoding_status":"completed"}},"sr_detail":{"default_set":true,"banner_img":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/5-pbhynSeq6Vvo_rYYvW32xjbRCy2_TkxKH9Urg-Zd8.png","allowed_media_in_comments":["giphy","static"],"user_is_banned":null,"free_form_reports":true,"community_icon":"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2qh1o/styles/communityIcon_6fzlk8ukx6s51.jpg?width=256&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d4b34493673611f858288f6db8ffbc44108bcac2","show_media":true,"description":"# Welcome to /r/aww!\n\n&gt; Things that make you go AWW! -- like puppies, bunnies, babies, and so on...\n\n&gt; Feel free to post pictures and videos of cute things.\n\n\n---\n\n##### Quick Links\n\n\n - [Subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/wiki/index)\n - [Reddit 101](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/categories/200073949-Reddit-101)\n - [Message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faww)\n\n### Rules\n\n1.

Comment sections are never locked and discussion is encouraged.\n\n##Rules:\n\n###1. Post must include a clever comeback\n* It has to be a great response (preferably *clever*) to someone. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule1)\n\n###2. No reposts\n* Do not repost content that hit the front page on this or other subreddits. Front page reposts can lead to a ban, and all other reposts will be removed. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule2)\n\n###3. We enforce quality control\n* If your post doesn't fit the standards of this sub, or is just generally an eyesore, it could be removed. This is at moderator discretion. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule3)\n\n###4. No circle-jerking\n* If some politician tweets something incredibly stupid, or another youtuber poses with a dead guy, there will be a flood of posts about it on this subreddit. We may remove or ban posts pertaining to it during that time, depending on how many posts there are, and how popular they've gotten. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule4)\n\n###5. No racism/sexism/homophobia\n* Bigotry is NOT tolerated on this subreddit. Do not post things that are racist/sexist/homophobic. Depending on the content, you may receive a ban, and your comment/submission will be removed. Again, you're not going to run up against this rule unless you attempt to do so. \n\n* **IF** a submission is a comeback due to someone being racist, that *may* be accepted. Otherwise, there is zero tolerance. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule5)\n\n\n###6. No Doxxing/brigading\n* Links to other subreddits, even np links are not allowed. Screenshots only. Screenshots from any source must obscure identifying information. The only exception is for people who are already public figures. Learn more [here](https://reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/wiki/moderation/faq/rule6)\n\n\n###7. Moderator discretion is FINAL\n* Many rules on the sub are enforced by moderators on post-by-post, comment-by-comment level.
